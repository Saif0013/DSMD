## About

DSMD was constructed based on the principles of knowledge graph. Our dictionary is composed of structured triples, where each entity
is defined as a concept, and these concepts are interconnected through relationships. This comprehensive dictionary boasts more than 348,000 triples, 
encompassing over 20,000 medicine brands and 1,500 generic medicines. It offers a groundbreaking approach to storing and accessing medical data.
Our dictionary facilitates various functionalities, including medicine brand information extraction,
brand-specific queries, as well as queries involving two words or question answering. We anticipate
that our dictionary will serve a broad spectrum of users, catering to both human users, such as
diverse range of healthcare professionals as well as AI applications.
