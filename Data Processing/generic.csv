Adalimumab,"Adalimumab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF-alpha and blocks its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also lyses surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated levels of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased levels of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Plaque Psoriasis, treatment with Adalimumab may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells.","The most common adverse reaction with Adalimumab was injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of Adalimumab in rheumatoid arthritis were clinical flare reaction, rash and pneumonia. 

Other adverse reactions of Adalimumab includes- Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis.
General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia.
Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis.
Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis.
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin). 
Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome).
Cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis.
Pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia.
Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis."
Acyclovir + Hydrocortisone,"Acyclovir is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with inhibitory activity against Herpes simplex viruses type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) in cell culture and in vivo. The inhibitory activity of Acyclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV. This viral enzyme converts Acyclovir into Acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In cell culture, Acyclovir Triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: 

Competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase
Incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain
Inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase

Hydrocortisone is the main glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex. It is used topically for its anti-inflammatory effects which suppress the clinical manifestations of the disease in a wide range of disorders where inflammation is a prominent feature.","The following most common adverse reactions (<1%) were local skin reactions like drying or flaking of the skin; burning or tingling, erythema; pigmentation changes, application site reactions including signs and symptoms of inflammation."
Acyclovir (Topical),"Acyclovir is an antiviral drug active against herpes simplex virus. Acyclovir is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with cell culture and in vivo inhibitory activity against HSV types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2). The inhibitory activity of acyclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV. This viral enzyme converts acyclovir into acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In cell culture, acyclovir triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, 2) incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain, and 3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase.","The most common adverse reactions at the site of topical application were dry lips, desquamation, dryness of skin, cracked lips, burning skin, pruritus, flakiness of skin, and stinging on skin; each adverse reaction occurred in less than 1% of patients receiving Acyclovir cream and placebo. Three patients on Acyclovir cream and one patient on placebo discontinued treatment due to an adverse event."
Acyclovir (Oral),"Aciclovir is a synthetic purine derivative. Aciclovir exerts its antiviral effect on Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Varicella-zoster virus by interfering with DNA synthesis and inhibiting viral replication. In cells infected with herpes virus, the antiviral activity of Aciclovir appears to depend principally on the intracellular conversion of the drug to Aciclovir Triphosphate. Aciclovir is converted to Aciclovir Monophosphate principally via virus coded thymidine kinase; the monophosphate is phosphorylated to the diphosphate via cellular guanylate kinase and then via another cellular enzyme to the triphosphate, which is the pharmacologically active form of the drug. 15-30% of an oral dose of the drug is absorbed from Gl tract. Peak plasma concentrations usually occur within 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. It is widely distributed into body tissues and fluids including the brain, saliva, lungs, liver, muscle, spleen, uterus, vaginal mucosa and secretions, CSF, and herpetic vesicular fluid. Aciclovir is excreted through the kidney by the glomerular filtration & tubular secretion.","Rash, gastrointestinal disturbance, rise in bilirubin and liver-related enzymes, increase in blood urea and creatinine, decrease in hematological indices, headache, neurological reaction, fatigue."
Acyclovir (Ophthalmic),"Acyclovir is an antiviral agent which is highly active in vitro against Herpes simplex (HSV) types I and II and Varicella zoster viruses, but its toxicity to mammalian cells is low. Acyclovir is phosphorylated to the active compound Acyclovir triphosphate after entry into herpes infected cell. The ­first step in this process requires the presence of the viral-coded thymidine kinase. Acyclovir triphosphate acts as an inhibitor of and substrate for the herpes specifi­ed DNA polymerase preventing further viral DNA synthesis without affecting normal cellular processes.","Very common: Superfi­cial punctate keratopathy. This did not necessitate an early termination of therapy and healed without apparent sequelae. Common: Transient mild stinging of the eye occurring immediately following application, conjunctivitis. Rare: Blepharitis."
Acyclovir (Injection),"Acyclovir exerts its antiviral e­ects on Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus by interfering with DNA synthesis and inhibiting viral replication. In cells infected with Herpes virus, the antiviral activity of Acyclovir appears to depend principally on the intracellular conversion of the drug to Acyclovir Triphosphate. Acyclovir is converted to Acyclovir Monophosphate principally via virus coded thymidine kinase, the monophosphate is phosphorylated to diphosphate via cellular guanylate kinase and then via other cellular enzymes to the Triphosphate, which is the pharmacologically active form of the drug.","Some infrequent adverse reactions are lethargy, obtundation, tremors, confusion, hallucinations, agitation, somnolence, psychosis, convulsions and coma, phlebitis, nausea, vomiting, reversible increases in liver-related enzymes, pruritus, urticaria, rashes, increases in blood urea and creatinine. Local inflammatory reactions may occur if Acyclovir IV Infusion is inadvertently infused into extracellular tissues."
Activated Charcoal,"Active charcoal binds the poison and prevents its absorption by the gastrointestinal tract. In cases of suspected poisoning, medical personnel administer activated carbon on the scene or at a hospital's emergency department. In rare situations, it may also be used in a hemoperfusion system to remove toxins from the blood stream of poisoned patients. Activated carbon has become the treatment of choice for many poisonings, and other decontamination methods such as ipecac-induced emesis or stomach pumping are now used rarely. It interrupts the enterohepatic and enteroenteric circulation of some drugs/toxins and their metabolites.","As most undesirable effects are based on post-marketing spontaneous reporting, precise frequency estimation is not possible. No adverse reactions to Ultracarbon are known to occur if taken in the recommended dosage to treat the diarrhoea. After very high doses as those taken in intoxications, constipation and intestinal obstruction (mechanical ileus) may occur in individual cases; this can be prevented by administering saline laxatives (eg, sodium sulfate). As medicinal charcoal is excreted in unchanged form, the stools turn black (discoloured faeces) after intake of Ultracarbon tablets."
Aclidinium Bromide + Formoterol Fumarate,"Aclidinium bromide: Aclidinium bromide is a long-acting anti-muscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical, in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of aclidinium bromide is predominantly a site-specific effect.Formoterol fumarate: Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) (beta 2-agonist). Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.",Most common adverse reactions (incidence 3% and more common than with placebo) include: upper respiratory tract infection and headache.
Acitretin,"Acitretin is a retinoid, an aromatic analogue of vitamin A. The mechanism of action of acitretin is unknown, however, evidence exists for a wide range of actions at various cellular and subcellular levels. These include regulation of RNA/DNA synthesis, modulation of factors which influence epidermal proliferation, modification of glycoprotein synthesis and modulation of the immune response. Whatever the exact mechanism of action, the most prominent effect of acitretin is a modulation of cellular differentiation in the epidermis which re-establishes a more normal pattern of cell growth.","Adverse effects are seen in most patients receiving acitretin. Most of the clinical side-effects of Acitretin are dose-related and are usually well-tolerated at the recommended dosages. However, the toxic dose of Acitretin is close to the therapeutic dose and most patients experience some side-effects during theinitial period whilst dosage is being adjusted. The skin and mucous membranes are most commonly affected. An initial worsening of psoriasis symptoms issometimes seen at the beginning of the treatment period."

Acetylcysteine,"Acetylcysteine is a mucolytic agent that reduces the viscosity of secretions probably by the splitting of disulphide bonds in mucoproteins. Moreover it gives antisecretory effect. These results in clearing of respiratory ducts and facilitate breathing. Acetylcysteine also has anti-oxidant properties by reacting with free radicals and also by serving as a precursor to glutathione, which is an important intra and extra-cellular antioxidant. By providing anti-oxidant action, it neutralizes exogenous and endogenous oxidants, which in fact act as pathogens in respiratory inflammations.","Like all medicines, Acetylcysteine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. In very rare cases, severe immune reactions may occur such as anaphylactic shock and severe skin reaction. In rare cases the oral administration can be followed by shortness of breath, upset stomach and bronchospasm.

It competitively and selectively binds to the post synaptic a1-adrenergic receptors in the lower urinary tract. It also relaxes sympathetic nervous stimulation, reduces resting urethral pressure and inhibits urethral hypertonia-induced sympathetic nervous stimulation. As an uroselective agent, Alfuzosin Hydrochloride preferentially binds to prostatic a1 receptors, blockage of these receptors result in reduction of BPH symptoms, improvement of urine flow and decreased potential for hypertensive events.","Classification of expected frequencies: Very common (<1/10), common (<1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (<1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (<1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Alfacalcidol,"The first step involved in the activation of vitamin D3 is a 25-hydroxylation which is catalysed by the 25-hydroxylase in the liver and then by other enzymes. The mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase catalyses the first reaction in the oxidation of the side chain of sterol intermediates. The active form of vitamin D3 (calcitriol) binds to intracellular receptors that then function as transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Like the receptors for other steroid hormones and thyroid hormones, the vitamin D receptor has hormone-binding and DNA-binding domains. The vitamin D receptor forms a complex with another intracellular receptor, the retinoid-X receptor, and that heterodimer is what binds to DNA. In most cases studied, the effect is to activate transcription, but situations are also known in which vitamin D suppresses transcription. Calcitriol increases the serum calcium concentrations by: increasing GI absorption of phosphorus and calcium, increasing osteoclastic resorption, and increasing distal renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Calcitriol appears to promote intestinal absorption of calcium through binding to the vitamin D receptor in the mucosal cytoplasm of the intestine. Subsequently, calcium is absorbed through formation of a calcium-binding protein.","Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, lassitude, polyuria, sweating, headache, thirst, vertigo, pruritus, rash, urticaria. Hypercalcaemia, hypercalciuria and ectopic calcification.In case of renal impairment, hyperphosphataemia. In hypercalcaemic dialysis patients, possibility of calcium influx from the dialysate should be considered."
Alendronic Acid + Vitamin D3,"Alendronate Sodium is a bisphosphonate that acts as a specific inhibitor of osteoclast mediated bone resorption. Alendronate is effective when administered at least 30 minutes before breakfast. It transiently distributes to soft tissues following administration but is then rapidly distributed to bone or excreted in the urine. Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78%. There is no evidence that Alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans. At the cellular level, Alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specially under osteoclasts. It inhibits osteoclast activity. In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption, leading to progressive gains in bone mass. Vitamin D is required for normal bone formation. Vitamin D insufficiency develops when both sunlight exposure and dietary intake are inadequate. Insufficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, increased parathyroid hormone levels, bone loss, and increased risk of skeletal fracture.","Usually mild and generally do not require discontinuation of therapy. Side effects include esophageal reactions, abdominal pain and distension, diarrhoea or constipation, flatulence, musculoskeletal pain, headache, rash, erythema and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate."
Alendronic acid,"Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover.Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [3H] alendronate in bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [3H] alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.","The commonest symptomatic side effects are constipation, diarrhoea, oesophageal ulcer, flatulence, dysphagia, musculoskeletal pain, headache, rarely rash, erythema, transient decrease in serum calcium and phosphate, nausea, vomiting, peptic ulceration, hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria and angio-oedema."
Alectinib,"Alectinib is a highly selective and potent ALK and RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor.In nonclinicalstudies, inhibition of ALK tyrosine kinase activity led to blockage of downstream signaling pathways including STAT 3 and PI3K/AKT and inducedtumor cell death (apoptosis). Alectinib demonstratedin vitroand in vivoactivity against mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, including mutations responsible forresistance to crizotinib.The major metabolite of alectinib (M4) has shown similar in vitropotency and activity. Based on nonclinicaldata, alectinib is not a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which are both efflux transporters in the blood brain barrier, and is therefore able to distribute into and be retained within the central nervous system. Alectinibinducedtumor regressionin nonclinicalmousexenograft models, including antitumor activity in the brain, and prolonged survival inintracranial tumor animal models.","The most common adverse drug reactions were constipation, edema including peripheral, generalized, eyelid, periorbital; myalgia (31% including myalgia and musculoskeletal pain), nausea, increased bilirubin (21% including increased blood bilirubin, hyperbilirubinemia and increased bilirubin conjugated), anemia (20%, including anemia and hemoglobin decreased), and rash (20%, including rash, rash maculopapular, dermatitis acneiform, erythema, rash generalized, rash papular, rash pruritic and rash macular)."
Alcaftadine,"This eye drops is a sterile topical ophthalmic solution containing Alcaftadine. Alcaftadine is an histamine receptor antagonist and inhibitor of the release of histamine from mast cell. It is also a potent histamine H2 and H4 receptor antagonist that has demonstrated anti-inflammatory property. In doing so, antihistaminic effect provides relief from itching associated with early phase of ocular allergic response, whereas mast cell stabilization inhibits the release of mediators such as cytokines and lipid mediators that play a role in late-phase response of allergic conjunctivitis.","The most frequent ocular reactions are eye irritation, burning or/and stinging upon instillation, eye redness and eye pruritus, nasopharyngitis and headache."
Albumin (Human),"The main function of albumin results from its contribution to plasma colloid oncotic pressure and transport function. Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and carries hormones, enzymes, medicines, and toxins. Other physiological functions include antioxidant properties, free radical scavenging, in addition to maintenance capillary membrane integrity. Exogenously administered albumin increases the oncotic pressure of the intravascular system, moving fluids from the interstitial space, thereby decreasing edema and increasing the circulating blood volume. The increase in volume reduces the concentration and viscosity of blood in patients with decreased circulating blood volume while maintaining cardiac output in shock. In dehydrated patients, negligible effects exist on circulating blood volume. In addition to the above albumin replaces protein in patients with hypoproteinemia until the cause of the deficiency can be determined.This drug has thousands of endogenous and exogenous targets. Human albumin also binds and carries a plethora of hydrophobic molecules, such as endogenous (i.e., cholesterol, fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroxine) or exogenous substances (for example, drugs and toxins), transition metal ions, as well as gas (nitric oxide [NO]), with resulting implications for their solubilisation, transport, metabolism, and detoxification.","Allergic or pyrogenic reactions are characterized primarily by fever and chills; rash, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia and hypotension have also been reported. Should an adverse reaction occur, slow or stop the infusion for a period of time which may result in the disappearance of the symptoms. If administration has been stopped and the patient requires additional Albumin (Human), material from a different lot should be used. Albumin (Human), particularly if administered rapidly, may result in vascular overload with resultant pulmonary edema."
Albendazole,"Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.","Gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, dizziness, changes in liver enzymes, rarely reversible alopecia; rash, fever, blood disorders including leucopenia and pancytopenia reported; allergic shock if cyst leakage; convulsion and meningism in cerebral disease."
Agomelatine,"This compound binds to the melatoninergic receptors and the serotoninergic 5-HT2c receptor giving rise to the Melatonin Agonist and Selective Serotonin Antagonist (MASSA) concept. The melatoninergic receptors MT1 and MT2, are G protein coupled receptors and they act through decreasing cAMP and cGMP. Agomelatine strongly binds to and stimulates the activity of MT1 and MT2 receptors normalizing the disturbed circadian rhythms and disrupted sleep-wake cycles. Unlike the existing antidepressants, agomelatine does not inhibit the uptake of serotonin, norepinephrine or dopamine. It inhibits 5HT-2C receptor (G protein coupled receptor which increases IP3/DAG secondary messenger system) found abundantly in the SCN, frontal cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia involved in the mood, motor and cognitive deficits associated with depressive states. 5HT-2C receptor antagonism increases norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the frontal cortex of the brain. This action of agomelatine produces antidepressant, antianxiety and also increases slow-wave sleep which is decreased in depression. It has been observed that it can increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus and may also have neuroprotective effects (by influencing glutamate release, glucocorticoid receptor gene expression and various neurotropic factors) which might also contribute to its antidepressant effects. A study has shown that agomelatine alleviates sleep disturbances after one week of therapy and by two weeks antidepressant effects manifest. The combined actions of agomelatine at MT1, MT2, and 5HT-2C receptors can improve the disturbed circadian rhythm and abnormal sleep pattern thus produce the antidepressant effect. These unique effects suggest that it might be effective for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder like anxiety and bipolar depression.","The commonly reported adverse effects in the clinical trials of agomelatine are headache, nausea and diarrhea."
Aflibercept,"Ablibercept is a recombinant fusion protein that acts as a decoy receptor for the ligands, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PIGF). It prevents these ligands to binding to endothelial receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, to suppress neovascularization and decrease vascular permeability. This ultimately will slow vision loss or the progression of metastatic colorectal cancer.","Most common adverse reactions (all grades, ≥20% incidence and at least 2% greater incidence for the Aflibercept/FOLFIRI regimen) were leukopenia, diarrhea, neutropenia, proteinuria, AST increased, stomatitis, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ALT increased, hypertension, weight decreased, decreased appetite, epistaxis, abdominal pain, dysphonia, serum creatinine increased, and headache"
Afatinib Dimaleate,"Afatinib covalently binds to the kinase domains of EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), and HER4 (ErbB4) and irreversibly inhibits tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation, resulting in downregulation of ErbB signaling. Certain mutations in EGFR, including non-resistant mutations in its kinase domain, can result in increased autophosphorylation of the receptor, leading to receptor activation, sometimes in the absence of ligand binding, and can support cell proliferation in NSCLC. Non-resistant mutations are defined as those occurring in exons constituting the kinase domain of EGFR that lead to increased receptor activation and where efficacy is predicted by 1) clinically meaningful tumor shrinkage with the recommended dose of afatinib and/or 2) inhibition of cellular proliferation or EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation at concentrations of afatinib sustainable at the recommended dosage according to validated methods. The most commonly found of these mutations are exon 21 L858R substitutions and exon 19 deletions.Afatinib demonstrated inhibition of autophosphorylation and/or in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing wild type EGFR and in those expressing selected EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, exon 21 L858R mutations, or other less common non-resistant mutations, at afatinib concentrations achieved in patients. In addition, afatinib inhibited in vitro proliferation of cell lines overexpressing HER2.Treatment with afatinib resulted in inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice implanted with tumors either overexpressing wild type EGFR or HER2 or in an EGFR L858R/T790M double mutant model.","Most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were diarrhea, rash/acneiform dermatitis, stomatitis, paronychia, dry skin, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, pruritus."
Adsorbed Tetanus Vaccine,"Tetanus toxoid adsorbed is a sterile suspension on aluminium phosphate suspended in an isotonic sodium chloride solution. The vaccine, after shaking, is a turbid liquid, whitish-gray in color. Adsorbed tetanus toxoid is prepared from tetanus toxin, produced by the growth of the bacterium Clostridium tetani in a peptone-based media. The toxin is converted to tetanus formol toxoid by treatment with formaldehyde solution. Formol tetanus toxoid is then purified, sterile, filtered and adsorbed to the aluminium phosphate.Thiomersal is added as preservative.","Adsorbed tetanus vaccine is generally well tolerated. Most recipients of tetanus vaccine experience some reactions upon vaccination. These are generally moderate and short in duration. They mainly consist of local reactions at the injection site (erythema, induration and tenderness). Systemic reactions (malaise and elevated temperature) are reported less commonly."
Adrenaline,"The actions of epinephrine resemble the effects of stimulation of adrenergic nerves. It acts on both alpha and beta receptor sites of sympathetic effector cells. Its most prominent actions are on the beta receptors of the heart, vascular and other smooth muscle. When given by rapid intravenous injection, it produces a rapid rise in blood pressure, mainly systolic, by (1) direct stimulation of cardiac muscle which increases the strength of ventricular contraction, (2) increasing the heart rate and (3) constriction of the arterioles in the skin, mucosa and splanchnic areas of the circulation.When given by slow intravenous injection, epinephrine usually produces only a moderate rise in systolic and a fall in diastolic pressure. Although some increase in pulse pressure occurs, there is usually no great elevation in mean blood pressure. Accordingly, the compensatory reflex mechanisms that come into play with a pronounced increase in blood pressure do not antagonize the direct cardiac actions of epinephrine as much as with catecholamines that have a predominant action on alpha receptors.","Common side effects are anxiety, restlessness, dizziness, headache, palpitations, rapid pulse, tremors, weakness and coldness of the extremities may be reported even with small doses and especially when given in conjunction with local anaesthetics."

It is also antioxidative, antitumoral and antimicrobial (in particular, the sesquiterpene derivatives). It also inhibits prostaglandin formation. The anti-inflammatory effects of turmeric are thought to be due to inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis and through this inhibition a change in prostaglandin formation. Alpha tumerone blocks the proliferation of human lymphocytes and decrease the activity of natural killer cells. Curcumin has antineoplastic effects through an antiproliferative mechanism.","Turmeric usually does not cause significant side effects; however, some people can experience stomach upset, nausea, dizziness, or diarrhea."
Cranberry [Vaccinium macrocarpon],Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) is a native North American plant commonly used for reduction in urinary tract infections (UTIs) occurrence and kidney stone management. Cranberry reduces the need for repeated antibiotic use in the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infection. Bacterial adherence to mucosal surfaces is generally considered to be the initial event in the pathogenesis of most infectious diseases due to bacteria in human such as UTIs. Cranberry inhibits adherence of bacteria to the lining of the urinary bladder and urethra. At higher dose it also works as a urinary antiseptic and reduces incidence of stone formation. Recent publications show as much as 65% reduction in UTI with cranberry consumption leading to reduced use of antibiotics and reduction in the number of incidences of recurrent cystitis.,Well tolerated in recommended dose. Occasionally diarrhea or mild gastrointestinal upset may occur at high dose.

Amino Acid + Calcium,"This tablet allows the intake of essential amino acids while minimising the amino-nitrogen intake. Following absorption, the keto- and hydroxy-analogues are transaminated to the corresponding essential amino acids by taking nitrogen from non-essential amino acids, therby decreasing the formation of urea by re-using the amino group. Hence, the accumulation of uraemic toxins is reduced. Keto and hydroxy acids do not induce hyperfiltration of the residual nephrons. Ketoacid containing supplements exert positive effect on renal hyper phosphataemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Moreover, renal osteodystrophy may be improved. The use of this tablet in combination with a very low protein diet allows to reduce nitrogen intake while preventing the deleterious consequences of inadequate dietary protein intake and malnutrition.","Hypercalcemia may develop. In this case it is recommended to decrease Vitamin D intake. If hypercalcaemia persists, reduce the dosage of this tablet as well as other source of calcium. The serum calcium level should be monitored regularly. Ensure sufficient calorie intake. No experience has been gained so far with the administration in paediatric patients."

Amikacin sulfate is active in vitro against penicillinase and nonpenicillinase-producing Staphylococcus species including methicillin-resistant strains.","The adverse effects have been reported with the use of Amikacin are tinnitus, vertigo, partial reversible or irreversible deafness, skin rash, drug fever, headache, paraesthesia, nausea and vomiting."
Ambroxol Hydrochloride,"Ambroxol is the active metabolite of bromhexine and it has been proven that this metabolite possesses a greater bronchosecretolytic effect than bromhexine. It improves sputum rheology by hydrating mechanism leading to liquefaction of mucus in the lumen of respiratory tract, thus facilitating expectoration of mucus and reducing dyspnea. It stimulates production of phospholipids of surfactant by alveolar cells, thus contributing to the lowering of superficial tension in the alveoli. It also reduces bronchial hyperactivity. Ambroxol has anti inflammatory properties owing to the inhibitory effect on the production of cellular cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites. In patients with COPD it traditionally improves airway patency.","Gastrointestinal side effects like epigastric pain, stomach overfill feeling may occur occasionally. Rarely allergic responses such as eruption, urticaria or angioneurotic edema have been reported."
Ambrisentan,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent autocrine and paracrine peptide. Two receptor subtypes, ETA and ETB, mediate the effects of ET-1 in the vascular smooth muscle and endothelium. The primary actions of ETA are vasoconstriction and cell proliferation, while the predominant actions of ETB are vasodilation, antiproliferation, and ET-1 clearance. Ambrisentan is a high-affinity ETA receptor antagonist with a high selectivity for the ETA versus ETB receptor (>4000-fold). The clinical impact of high selectivity for ETA is not known.The pharmacokinetics of Ambrisentan (S-Ambrisentan) in healthy subjects are dose proportional. The absolute bioavailability of Ambrisentan is not known. Ambrisentan is absorbed with peak concentrations occurring approximately 2 hours after oral administration in healthy subjects and PAH patients. Food does not affect its bioavailability. In vitro studies indicate that Ambrisentan is a substrate of P-gp. Ambrisentan is highly bound to plasma proteins (99%). The elimination of Ambrisentan is predominantly by non-renal pathways, but the relative contributions of metabolism and biliary elimination have not been well characterized. In plasma, the AUC of 4-hydroxymethyl Ambrisentan accounts for approximately 4% relative to parent Ambrisentan AUC. Thein vivo inversion of S-Ambrisentan to R-Ambrisentan is negligible. The mean oral clearance of Ambrisentan is 38 mL/min and 19 mL/min in healthy subjects and in PAH patients, respectively. Although Ambrisentan has a 15-hour terminal half-life, the mean trough concentration of Ambrisentan at steady-state is about 15% of the mean peak concentration and the accumulation factor is about 1.2 after long-term daily dosing, indicating that the effective half-life of Ambrisentan is about 9 hours.",Decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit have followed administration of other endothelin receptor antagonists and were observed in clinical studies with Ambrisentan
Amantadine Hydrochloride,"The mechanism by which amantadine exerts its antiviral activity is not clearly understood. It appears to mainly prevent the release of infectious viral nucleic acid into the host cell by interfering with the function of the transmembrane domain of the viral M2 protein. In certain cases, amantadine is also known to prevent virus assembly during virus replication. It does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A virus vaccine.Amantadine inhibits the replication of influenza A virus isolates from each of the subtypes, i.e., H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2. It has very little or no activity against influenza B virus isolates. A quantitative relationship between the in vitrosusceptibility of influenza A virus to amantadine and the clinical response to therapy has not been established in man. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of amantadine required to inhibit by 50% the growth of virus (ED50) in tissue culture vary greatly (from 0.1 µg/mL to 25.0 µg/mL) depending upon the assay protocol used, size of virus inoculum, isolates of influenza A virus strains tested, and the cell type used. Host cells in tissue culture readily tolerated amantadine up to a concentration of 100 µg/mL.","The adverse effects of Amantadine are generally mild and, when they occur, may diminish or cease after a week or more on the medication. The most commonly reported side effects include nausea, dizziness/ lightheadedness, and insomnia.Other side effects may include edema of ankles, livedo reticularis; anxiety, elevation of mood, headache, lethargy, hallucinations, ataxia, slurred speech, blurred vision, loss of concentration, nervousness, depression, myalgia, palpitations, orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth, anorexia, constipation and diaphoresis."
Alverine Citrate,"Alverine Citrate is a smooth muscle relaxant. Smooth muscle is a type of muscle that is not under voluntary control; it is the muscle present in places such as the gut and uterus. Alverine Citrate acts directly on the muscle in the gut, causing it to relax. This prevents the muscle spasm which occur in the gut in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. Alverine Citrate also relaxes the smooth muscle in the uterus. It is therefore also used to treat painful menstruation, which is caused by muscle spasm in the uterus (dysmenorrhea).","Possible side effects may include nausea, headache, dizziness, itching, rash and allergic reactions."
Aluminium Oxide + Magnesium Trisilicate,Aluminum hydroxide neutralizes stomach hydrocloride to form AICI3 salt plus water; increases gastric pH. Magnesium Trisilicate neutralizes gastric acidity by increasing gastric pH,"Diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, vomiting."
Aluminium Hydroxide + Magnesium Hydroxide + Simethicone,"This is the mixture of non-systemic acid neutralizing substances and antiflatulent. This preparation offers reliability as well as long action. Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide induce the relief of ulcer by neutralizing gastric acid secreted from parietal cells of the stomach. The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled.This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients. Following oral administration, the drug is excreted unchanged in the feces.","Gastrointestinal side effects are uncommon. Occasionally, if excessive amount is consumed, diarrhea, constipation or regurgitation may occur."
Aluminium Hydroxide + Magnesium Hydroxide,"This drug is well-balanced combination of essential non-systemic antacids which excel in efficacy and palatability. These are dependable antacid preparations without acid rebound, constipating or cathertic effects. Both the preparations provide symptomatic relief of hyperacidity associated with heartburn, acid ingestion or sour stomach.Aluminium hydroxide gel, a slow acting antacid and an adsorbent with prolonged effect, has high neutralizing power. Magnesium Hydroxide possesses a slow but sustained acid neutralizing property. Antacids of both tablet and suspension possess adsorbent property. They form a protecting coating over the ulcer surface facilitating its healing; thus protecting the sensitive mucosa of stomach and duodenum from further irritation.","Long term use of any antacid results in alkaluria, which may predispose to nephrolithiasis by forming precipitation of calcium phosphate."
Aluminium Chloride Hexahydrate,"Aluminium Chloride Hexahydrate acts locally in the stratum corneum and terminal duct to relieve hyperhidrosis. Aluminium salts cause an obstruction of the ducts of sweat glands at the skin surface. It seems that the metal (Aluminium) ions precipitate with mucopolysaccharides, damaging epithelial cells along with the duct lumen and forms a plug (gel) that blocks sweat output.","Aluminium Chloride Hexahydrate is normally well tolerated and adverse effects are only mild and short-lasting. But sometimes irritation of the skin like- stinging, burning, redness, swelling, tingling or itching of treated skin areas may occur. These irritations may be alleviated by use of a weak corticosteroid cream."
Alteplase,"Alteplase is a serine protease responsible for fibrin-enhanced conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. It produces limited conversion of plasminogen in the absence of fibrin. When introduced into the systemic circulation at pharmacologic concentration, alteplase binds to fibrin in a thrombus and converts the entrapped plasminogen to plasmin. This initiates local fibrinolysis with limited systemic proteolysis.Pharmacodynamics: Following administration of 100 mg Alteplase, there is a decrease (16%-36%) in circulating fibrinogen. In a controlled trial, 8 of 73 patients (11%) receiving Alteplase (1.25 mg/kg body weight over 3 hours) experienced a decrease in fibrinogen to below 100 mg/dL.Pharmacokinetics: Alteplase in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients is rapidly cleared from the plasma with an initial half-life of less than 5 minutes. There is no difference in the dominant initial plasma half-life between the 3-hour and accelerated regimens for AMI. The plasma clearance of alteplase is 380-570 mL/min, primarily mediated by the liver. The initial volume of distribution approximates plasma volume.","The following adverse reactions are:

Bleeding 
Orolingual Angioedema 
Cholesterol Embolization
Reembolization of Deep Venous Thrombi during Treatment for Acute Massive Pulmonary
Embolism."
Alprazolam,"Alprazolam is a triazole analog of the 1,4-benzodiazepine class of drugs. It is an anxiolytic with hypnotic and anticonvulsive properties. Alprazolam is presumed to produce its effects via interacting with the Gamma Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)- benzodiazepine receptor complex. Like all benzodiazepines, it causes a dose-related CNS depressant activity varying from mild impairment of task performance to hypnosis.","Side effects, if occur, are generally observed at the beginning of therapy and usually disappear upon continued medication. The most frequent side effects are drowsiness and light-headedness. The other side effects, that may occur include depression, headache, confusion, dry mouth, constipation, etc."
Alphanate,"Antihemophilic Factor/ Von Willebrand Factor Complex (Human) contains Antihemophilic Factor (FVIII) and von Willebrand Factor (VWF), constituents of normal plasma, which are required for clotting. The administration of Alphanate temporarily increases the plasma level of FVIII, thus minimizing the hazard of hemorrhage in patients with hemophilia A. FVIII is an essential cofactor in activation of factor X leading to formation of thrombin and fibrin. VWF promotes platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion on damaged vascular endothelium; it also serves as a stabilizing carrier protein for the procoagulant protein FVIII.","The most frequent adverse events reported with Alphanate in >5% of patients are respiratory distress, pruritus, rash, urticaria, faceedema, paresthesia, pain, fever, chills, joint pain and fatigue"

Unknown frequency of occurrence-Skin redness, itching hives, blisters and allergic skin reaction (contact dermatitis)."
Amorolfine Hydrochloride (cream),"Amorolfine is a topical antimycotic. Amorolfine belongs to a new chemical class, and its fungicidal action is based on an alteration of the fungal cell membrane targeted primarily on sterol biosynthesis. The ergosterol content is reduced, and at the same time unusual sterically nonplanar sterols accumulate.","Side effects are Skin Irritation, erythema, pruritus, skin burning sensation, Hypersensitivity (systemic allergic reaction)."
Amlodipine Besilate + Valsartan,"Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Valsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of Angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of Angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for Angiotensin II synthesis. Amlodipine and Valsartan have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. Both Amlodipine and Valsartan lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral resistance, but calcium influx blockade and reduction of Angiotensin II vasoconstriction are complementary mechanisms.","Generally been mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects include peripheral edema, nasal congestion, sore throat and discomfort when swallowing, upper respiratory tract infection, dizziness etc."
Amlodipine Besilate + Telmisartan,"This is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.","Dizziness, peripheral edema, migraine, headache, paraesthesia, vertigo, bradycardia, palpitations, hypotension, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, myalgia, spasm, erectile dysfunction,chest pain, fatigue, edema etc."
Amlodipine Besilate + Olmesartan Medoxomil,"Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).","The most common side effects include peripheral edema, headache, flushing, and dizziness. It can also cause Intestinal problems known a sprue-like enteropathy."
Amlodipine Besilate + Benazepril Hydrochloride,"The combination of Amlodipine and Benazepril is used to treat high blood pressure. Benazepril and benazeprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals. While the mechanism through which Benazepril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, Benazepril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. The rate and extent of absorption of Benazepril and Amlodipine are not significantly different, respectively, from the rate and extent of absorption of Benazepril and Amlodipine from individual tablet formulations. Following oral administration of this capsule, peak plasma concentrations of Benazepril are reached in 0.5-2 hours. Peak plasma concentrations of Amlodipine are reached 6-12 hours after administration of this capsule; the extent of absorption is 64%-90%. Over 700 patients received Benazepril/Amlodipine once daily in five double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Benazepril/Amlodipine lowered blood pressure within 1 hour, with peak reductions achieved 2-8 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Once-daily doses of Benazepril/Amlodipine using Benazepril doses of 10-20 mg and Amlodipine doses of 2.5-10 mg decreased seated pressure (systolic/diastolic) 24 hours after dosing by about 10-25/6-13 mmHg.","Benazepril/Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in patients with hypertension for at least 6 months and more than 1 year. The reported side effects were generally mild and transient, and there was no relationship between side effects and age, sex, race or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects was required in approximately 4% of patients treated with Benazepril/Amlodipine and in 3% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Benazepril/Amlodipine in U.S. studies were cough and edema. The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials in more than 1% of patients treated with Benazepril/Amlodipine are cough, headache, dizziness and edema.The incidence of edema was statistically greater in patients treated with Amlodipine monotherapy than in patients treated with the combination. Edema and certain other side effects are associated with Amlodipine monotherapy in a dose-dependent manner, and appear to affect women more than men. The addition of Benazepril resulted in lower incidences as shown in study; the protective effect of Benazepril was independent of race and (within the range of doses tested) of dose.Other rare side effects are angioedema, asthenia, fatigue, insomnia, nervousness, anxiety, tremor, decreased libido, flushing, hot flashes, rash, skin nodule, dermatitis, dry mouth, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, esophagitis, hypokalemia, pharyngitis etc."
Amlodipine Besilate + Atorvastatin,"It is a combination product containing Amlodipine Besilate BP equivalent to 5 mg Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker and Atorvastatin calcium INN equivalent to 10 mg Atorvastatin, a statin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor). Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Atorvastatin calcium is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent. It is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA). This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoAto mevatonate, an early and rate limiting step in the synthesis of cholesterol.","Amlodipine: General: Since the vasodilatation induced by Amlodipine is gradual in onset, acute hypotension has rarely been reported after oral administration of Amlodipine. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when administering Amlodipine as with any other peripheral vasodilator particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure: Although hemodynamic studies and a controlled trial in Class-II-III heart failure patients have shown that Amlodipine did not lead to clinical deterioration as measured by exercise tolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction, and clinical symptoms. In general, all calcium channel blockers should be used with caution in patients with heart failure. Beta-blocker Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria has been reported with other drugs in this class. Atorvastatin: Atorvastatin may cause an elevation in serum creatine phosphokinase levels. This should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain in patients on therapy with Atorvastatin. Uncomplicated myalgia has been reported in Atorvastatin-treated patients. Atorvastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Side effects: Atorvastatin is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects reported commonly include constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, myalgia, diarrhea, asthenia and insomnia."
Amlodipine Besilate + Atenolol,"This is a fixed-dose combination of Amlodipine and Atenolol. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle; it has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle than on cardiac muscle. Amlodipine is a peripheral vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload. Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS. Atenolol also causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand by virtue of its negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects.","The combination of Amlodipine and Atenolol is well tolerated. Overall side-effects includefatigue, headache, edema, nausea, drowsiness, anxiety and depression."
Amlodipine Besilate,"Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, with a long duration of action, used for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Amlodipine influences the myocardial cells, the cells within the specialized conducting system of the heart, and the cells of vascular smooth muscle. Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate. This in turn results in an increase in myocardial oxygen supply and cardiac output.","The most common adverse effects of amlodipine are associated with vasodilatory action, such as dizziness, flushing, headache, hypotension and peripheral edema. Gastrointestinal disturbances, increased micturition frequency, lethargy, eye pain and mental depression may also occur. A paradoxical increase in ischaemic chest pain may occur at the start of the treatment and in a few patients excessive fall in blood pressure has led to cerebral or myocardial ischaemia or transient blindness. Rashes, fever and abnormalities in liver function due to hypersensitivity reaction of Amlodipine may occur."
Amlexanox,"The mechanism of action by which Amlexanox accelerates healing of aphthous ulcers is unknown. In vitro studies have demonstrated Amlexanox to be a potent inhibitor of the formation and release of inflammatory mediators (histamine and leukotrienes) from mast cells, neutrophils and mononuclear cells. Given orally to animals, Amlexanox has demonstrated anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory activities and has been shown to suppress both immediate and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. The relevance of these activities of Amlexanox to its effects on aphthous ulcers has not been established. After a single oral application of 100 mg of paste (5 mg Amlexanox), maximal serum levels are observed at 2.4 hours. Most of the systemic absorption of Amlexanox is via the gastrointestinal tract and the amount absorbed directly through the active ulcer is not a significant portion of the applied dose. The half-life for elimination was 3.5 +/- 1.1 hours in healthy individuals.","Adverse reactions reported by 1-2% of patients were transient pain, stinging and/or burning at the site of application. Infrequent (<1%) adverse reactions in the clinical studies were contact mucositis, nausea, and diarrhea."
Amitriptyline Hydrochloride + Chlordiazepoxide,"Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant and Chlordiazepoxide is an anxiolytic. Amitriptyline inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. This interference with the reuptake is responsible for the antidepressant activity of Amitriptyline. Chlordiazepoxide works by enhancing GABA-mediated chloride influx through GABA receptor channels, causing membrane hyperpolarization. The net neuro-inhibitory effects result in the observed sedative and anxiolytic effect.","Side effects: Many symptoms common to the depressive state, such as anorexia, fatigue, weakness, restlessness and lethargy, have been reported as side effects of treatment with this preparation.Adverse reactions: Most frequently reported were drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, dizziness and bloating. Less commonly included vivid dreams, impotence, tremor, confusion and nasal congestion."
Amitriptyline Hydrochloride,"The mechanism of action of this drug is not fully elucidated. It is suggested that amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for the re-uptake of transmitter amines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain. These amines are important in regulating mood. The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects. This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms. Whether its analgesic effects are related to its mood-altering activities or attributable to a different, less obvious pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown.","Anticholinergic: Excessive perspiration, dry mouth, blurred vision, hyperpyrexia, urinary retention and urinary tract dilatation.

Amiodarone Hydrochloride,"Amiodarone Hydrochloride is used to correct abnormal rhythms of the heart. Amiodarone is considered a ""broad spectrum"" antiarrhythmic medication. The most important electrical effects of the drug includes : a delay in the rate at which the heart’s electrical system ""recharges"" after the heart contracts (repolarisation); a prolongation in the electrical phase during which the heart’s muscle cells are electrically stimulated (action potential); a slowing of the speed of electrical conduction (how fast each individual impulse is conducted through the heart’s electrical system); a reduction in the rapidity of firing of the normal generator of electrical impulses in the heart (the heart’s pacemaker); and a slowing of conduction through various specialised electrical pathways (called accessory pathways). In addition to being an antiarrhythmic medication, Amiodarone also causes blood vessels to dilate. Because of this effect it also may be of benefit in patients with  congestive heart failure. This effect can result in drop of blood pressure.","The most severe side effects of Amiodarone therapy are related to the lungs. These reactions can be fatal. Patients should report any symptoms of cough, fever, or painful breathing. Although quite rare, fatal liver toxicity may occur with Amiodarone therapy. Reversible corneal microdeposits (sometimes with night glare), rarely impaired vision due to optic neuritis; peripheral neuropathy and myopathy (usually reversible on withdrawal); bradycardia and conduction disturbances; phototoxicity and rarely persistent skin discolouration; hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism; raised serum transaminases; jaundice, hepatitis and cirrhosis are reported. Other rare complaints are nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, tremor, sweating, vertigo, headache, sleeplessness, fatigue, alopecia, benign raised intracranial pressure, ataxia, rashes, vasculitis, renal involvement, thrombocytopenia, haemolytic or aplastic anaemia. In some cases, dose of Amiodarone may be reduced. In other cases, Amiodarone therapy may need to be stopped."

Artemether + Lumefantrine,"This preparation contains a fixed ratio of 1:6 parts of Artemether and Lumefantrine respectively. Artemether is a derivative of naturally occurring substance Artemisinin. Lumefantrine is a synthetic racemic fluorine mixture belonging to the aryl amino alcohol family like other anti-malarials (e.g. Quinine, mafloquine, halofantrine). Both components act in the food vacuoles of malarial parasites, where they are thought to interfere with the conversion of haem, a toxic intermediate formed during haemoglobin breakdown, to the non-toxic haemozin (a malaria pigment). Lumefantrine is thought to interfere with the polymerization process, while Artemether generates reactive metabolites as a result of interaction between the peroxide bridge and haem iron. Both Artemether and Lumefantrine have a secondary action involving inhibition of nucleic acid - protein synthesis within the malarial parasites. This tablet did not induce resistance. This tablet is active against blood stages of Plasmodium vivax, but it is not active against hypnozoites. Therefore, sequential treatment with premaquine should be used to achieve hypnozoite eradication.","It is generally very well tolerated by children and adults, with most adverse effects are of mild to moderate severity and duration.

This compound has also been authorized by the Japan Health Food and Nutrition Food Association, and has passed strict evaluation standards set under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Welfare."
Aprepitant,"Aprepitant is a selective high affinity antagonist of human substance P neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. When substance P attaches to these receptors, it causes nausea and vomiting. Aprepitant stops substance P from binding to the NK1 receptors. By blocking the receptors, Aprepitant can prevent nausea and vomiting, which often happens after chemotherapy or as a complication of surgery.","Constipation, Hypotension, Pruritus, Pyrexia"
Apremilast,"Apremilast is a novel, orally available small molecule inhibitor of type-4 cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE-4). PDE-4 is a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-specific phosphodiesterase that is predominantly located in inflammatory cells. By inhibiting PDE-4, apremilast increases intracellular levels of cAMP and thereby inhibits the production of multiple proinflammatory mediators including PDE-4, TNF-alpha, interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-gamma, leukotrienes, and nitric oxide synthase. By targeting a central component of the inflammatory signaling cascade rather than a single inflammatory marker, PDE-4 inhibition may restore the homeostatic balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory signalling.","The most frequently occurring side effects of Apremilast are nausea, diarrhea and headache. Other less frequent side effects are upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, naospharyngitis, abdominal pain, hypersensitivity, gastroesophageal reflux disease, dyspepsia, fatigue, decrease appetite, cough, rash, insomnia."

Antihemophilic Factor [Factor VIII],"Factor VIII is required for clot formation and maintenance of haemostasis. It activates factor X in conjunction with activated factor IX. Activated factor X then converts prothrombin to thrombin, which converts fibrinogen to fibrin, and forms a stable clot with factor XIII. Factor VIII is used for replacement therapy in patients with haemophilia A.","Allergic reactions e.g. chills, chest tightness, fever, headache, hyperfibrinogenaemia, jittery feeling, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, stinging at infusion site, stomach discomfort, tingling, urticaria, vasomotor reactions with rapid infusion."
Anti-Thymocyte Globulin,"The mechanism of action by which polyclonal antilymphocyte preparations suppress immune responses is not fully understood. Possible mechanisms by which Anti-Thymocyte Globulin may induce immunosuppression in vivo include: T-cell clearance from the circulation and modulation of T-cell activation, homing, and cytotoxic activities. Anti-Thymocyte Globulin includes antibodies against T-cell markers such as CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11a, CD18, CD25, CD44, CD45, HLA-DR, HLA Class I heavy chains, and ß2 micro-globulin. In vitro, Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (concentrations >0.1 mg/mL) mediates T-cell suppressive effects via inhibition of proliferative responses to several mitogens. In patients, T-cell depletion is usually observed within a day after initiating Anti-Thymocyte Globulin therapy. Anti-Thymocyte Globulin has not been shown to be effective for treating antibody-mediated (humoral) rejections.","The most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities (incidence>5% higher than comparator) are urinary tract infection, abdominal pain, hypertension, nausea, shortness of breath, fever, headache, anxiety, chills, increased potassium levels in the blood, low counts of platelets and white blood cells"
Antazoline + Tetryzoline,"Antazoline is an anti-histamine of the ethylenediamine class, which are selective HI-antagonist. Effects mediated by HI receptors include the contraction of smooth muscle and the dilation and increased permeability of the capillaries. Tetryzoline is a sympathomimetic with alpha-adrenergic activity. Its vasoconstrictive effect reduces redness and edema in allergic conjunctivitis. Antihistamines, which act by blocking the HI histamine receptor, are highly effective in providing relief of itching but are not very active in relieving the associated redness. The use of products combining an anti-histamine and a vasoconstrictor is well established in the symptomatic relief of allergic eye disease.","The most common adverse effect is burning/stinging upon installation, which is mild and transient in nature."
Anidulafungin,"Anidulafungin is a semi-synthetic echinocandin with antifungal activity. Anidulafungin inhibits glucan synthase, an enzyme present in fungal, but not mammalian cells. This results in inhibition of the formation of 1,3-β-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall.","Adults-

Mahadrakkharist [Grape extract],"Grapes contain beneficial bioflaVonoid-like ingredients called ""proanthocyanidins"" (PCOs or OPCs). Proanthocyanidins are believed to protect cell membranes by neutralizing particularly harmful free radicals called ""lipid peroxides"". PCOs may strengthen the capillary walls and skin. It has been reported to inhibit the release of inflammatory chemicals, such as histamine and prostaglandins. PCOs have been used in allergies and asthma because of their reported ability to slow histamine release from mast cells. Resveratrol, a molecule has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may protect against COPD and asthma (Wood 2010). A cell culture study found that resveratrol inhibited the release of all measured inflammatory mediators (cytokines) from immune cells extracted from the alveoli of smokers and non-smokers with COPD. Moreover, while resveratrol attenuates the release of inflammatory mediators in airway smooth muscle cells, it preserves signaling of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may be protective against emphysema. More recently, the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol have been associated with inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kB, possibly mediated via the inhibition of l-kB kinase. Resveratrol has several activities that may account for its possible cardioprotective action. These include inhibition of the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Resveratrol also has been found to exert a strong inhibitory effect on superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production by macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides or phorbol esters. It also increases nitric oxide and decreases lactate dehydrogenase levels in the carotid blood and effective against ischemia-reperfusion induced arrythmias. Triterpenes roxburghiadiol A and B isolated from this plant Aglaia roxburghiana has the potent anti-inflammatory activity and mast cell degranulation induced by A. roxburghiana extracts and the triterpenes.Pharmacokinetics: From animal and limited human studies,it appears that resveratrol is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following its ingestion. Resveratrol is found in the form of a glucuronide conjugate after crossing the small intestine and entering the blood circulation. In case of human, five metabolites of resveratrolTiave been detected in urine, such as resveratrol monosulphate, two isomeric forms of resveratrol monoglucuronide, dihydroresveratrol monosulphate and dihydroresveratrol monoglucuronide. 56% sulphate and glucuronide conjugates excrete through urine (Baur and Sinclair,2006)","There are no side effects associated with the use of Drakkha in the above-mentioned therapeutic doses. Drakkha has been used safely as an ayurvedic medicine for hundreds of years. But in very rare case stomach pain, headache and an allergic reaction have been reported."
Lutein + Zeaxanthin,"Lutein and Zeaxanthin are nutritionally important carotenoids that protect healthy cells from oxidative stress and free radical damage. Lutein and Zeaxanthin have immunostimulant and photoprotectant properties. Recent research has shown that these important carotenoids are major eye pigments of the retina. Lutein and Zeaxanthin are especially concentrated in rods which are specialized light sensitive cell or photoprotector in retina and responsible for black and white vision in the dark. Scientific evidence clearly suggests that Lutein and Zeaxanthin has important role in the retina to protect tissue from the damaging effects of high-energy blue spectrum light. The uncontrolled generation of free radicals in the eye and harmful light are believed to ultimately lead to age related macular degeneration (AMD), cataracts, retinitis pigmentosa. Lutein and Zeaxanthin may also have effects on skin health and anti-aging activity.",No adverse side effects have been reported. Ames testing has demonstrated an absence of any mutagenic effects for purified Lutein and Zeaxanthin.

Azelaic Acid,Azelaic acid has been shown to possess antimicrobial activity against Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidennidis. The antimicrobial action may be attributable to the inhibition of microbial cellular protein synthesis. A normalization of keratinization leading to an anticomedonal effect of Azelaic acid may also contribute to its clinical activity.,"Local skin irritation (e.g. erythema, scaling, itching or burning) occurs in occasional cases, usually at the start of treatment. However, in the majority of cases the irritation is mild and regresses as treatment continues."
Azathioprine,"Azathioprine antagonizes purine metabolism and may inhibit synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins. It may also interfere with cellular metabolism and inhibit mitosis. Its mechanism of action is likely due to incorporation of thiopurine analogues into the DNA structure, causing chain termination and cytotoxicity.","Opportunistic infections especially in transplant patients receiving concomitant other immunosuppressants. Bone marrow depression, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea. Uncommonly, anaemia, hypersensitivity reactions, cholestasis, pancreatitis."
Axitinib,"Axitinib has been shown to inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 at therapeutic plasma concentrations. These receptors are implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression. VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation and survival were inhibited by axitinib in vitro and in mouse models.

Avanafil,"Avanafil is a selective phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) enzyme inhibitor used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction caused by diabetes, age induced oxidative stress or other complications. Avanafil inhibits the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) by avanafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP.","Most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 2%) include headache, flushing, nasal congestion, nasopharyngitis, and back pain"
Atropine Sulfate,"Atropine binds to and inhibit muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, producing a wide range of anticholinergic effects. Atropine is an anticholinergic agent which competitively blocks the muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues such as the heart, intestines, bronchial muscles, iris and secretory glands. Some central stimulation may occur. Atropine abolishes bradycardia and reduces heart block due to vagal activity. Smooth muscles in the bronchi and gut are relaxed while glandular secretions are reduced. It also has mydriatic and cycloplegic effect.","Injection: Dry mouth, dysphagia, constipation, flushing and dryness of skin, tachycardia, palpitations, arrhythmias, mydriasis, photophobia, cycloplegia, raised intraocular pressure.

This antagonism is inhibited, and neuromuscular block reversed, by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine, edrophonium, and pyridostigmine.","Skin flush, erythema, pruritus, urticaria, wheezing, increased bronchial secretions, bronchospasm, cyanosis, angioedema, CV effects (e.g. bradycardia); wheals and erythema at inj site. Potentially Fatal: Anaphylaxis."
Atosiban Acetate,"It binds to membrane bound oxytocin receptors on the myometrium and prevents oxytocin-stimulated increases in inositol triphosphate production. This ultimately prevents release of stored calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and subsequent opening of voltage gated calcium channels. This shutdown of cytosolic calcium increase prevents contractions of the uterine muscle, reducing the frequency of contractions and inducing uterine quiescence.Atosiban has more recently been found to act as a biased ligand at oxytocin receptors. It acts as an antagonist of Gq coupling, explaining the inhibition of the inositol triphosphate pathway thought to be responsible for the effect on uterine contraction, but acts as an agonist of Gi coupling. This agonism produces a pro-inflammatory effect in the human amnion, activating pro-inflammatory signal tranducer NF-κB. It is thought that this reduces atosiban's effectiveness compared to agents which do not produce inflammation as inflammatory mediators are known to play a role in the induction of labour.","Very common (affects more than 1 in 10 people): feeling sick (nausea).Common (affects less than 1 in 10 people): headache, feeling dizzy, hot flushes, being sick (vomiting), fast heartbeat, Low blood pressure.

Atenolol,The synthesis of atenolol resulted from attempts to produce a β-adrenoceptor antagonist that would competitively block β1 (cardiac) receptors but have no effect on β2-receptors. It is classified as a β1 selective (cardioselective) β-adrenergic receptor antagonist with no membranestability activity and no partial agonist activity. It is markedly the most hydrophilic of the currently available β- blockers and thus penetrates the lipid of cell membranes poorly,"In a series of investigations in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia and hypotension occurred more commonly, as expected for any beta blocker. In addition, a variety of adverse efects has been reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and may be considered potential adverse efects of Atenolol.

For this purpose, the daytime dosage may be reduced and the evening dosage increased."
Bacitracin Zinc + Polymyxin B Sulfate,"This ophthalmic ointment is a sterile antimicrobial ointment for ophthalmic use, cointaining Polymixin-B sulphate and Bacitracin Zinc. Polymixin-B sulphate and Becitracin Zinc are both bactericidal antibiotics, The former exerts its action by binding with the cellular membrane and the later by inhibiting bacterial cell wall development.","Sometimes this ointment may be absorbed in the blood, but shows no blood related toxicity. Moreover Allergic reaction, eye irritation, eye redness, itching, swelling may occur."
Bacillus Clausii spores,"Bacillus clausii spores is a probiotic which is useful for the management of imbalance of intestinal bacterial flora due to diverse causes. The possible presence of corpuscles visible in the vials of Enterogermina is due to aggregates of Bacillus clausii spores and does not, therefore, indicate that the product has undergone any changes.","No side effects have been reported with the use of Enterogermina. However, it is important to communicate any undesirable effects."
Aztreonam,"Aztreonam is a synthetic bactericidal monobactam antibiotic. It inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by blocking peptidoglycan crosslinking. The inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis occurs due to a high affinity of Aztreonam for penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3). By binding to PBP3, Aztreonam inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins. It is possible that Aztreonam interferes with an autolysin inhibitor.","Local reactions such as phlebitis/thrombophlebitis following IV administration and discomfort/swelling at the injection site following IM administration may occur. Systemic reactions like diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting, and rash may occur. Other side effects include anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, pancytopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, eosinophilia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, abdominal cramps, dermatitis, urticaria, pruritus, hypotension, flushing, seizure, weakness, headache, fever, malaise may occur."
Azithromycin Dihydrate (Ophthalmic),"Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:

Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes
Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae
Other microorganisms: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.
Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci
Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila
Anaerobic microorganisms: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia","Eye irritation, contact dermatitis, corneal erosion, dry eye, punctate keratitis etc."

St. John’s Wort,"St. John’s Wort is an herb which is most commonly used to treat for mild to moderate depression and conditions that sometimes go along with depression such as anxiety, tiredness, loss of appetite and insomnia. The main components of St. John’s Wort are Hypericin and Hyperforin which are responsible for its effects against depression. Although the exact mechanism of action of St. John’s Wort is unknown but it may inhibit the reuptake of Serotonin and Noradrenaline, inhibit Monoamine Oxidase (MAO), up-regulate Serotonin receptor, and reduce depression.","St. John’s Wort is generally safe for most people. It sometimes may cause dry mouth, dizziness, constipation and diarrhea."
Spirulina,"Spirulina has such positive TTutritionafcontent that it is called the world's richest whole-food which can be found naturally. It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate.How does it work-

About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Spirulina is generally well tolerated. Occasional diarrhea, gastrointestinal discomfort, such as nausea have been reported. Also there are few reports of allergic reactions to spirulina containing supplements."
Silymarin [Milk thistle],"Silymarin, a flavonoid complex of Silybum marianum or Milk thistle, is the biologically active component.

Betamethasone + Calcipotriol,"Betamethasone Dipropionate is a potent topically-active corticosteroid producing prompt, marked and prolonged anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, vasoconstrictive and immunosuppressive properties, without curing the underlying condition. These effects can be enhanced under occlusive conditions due to increased penetration of stratum corneum (by approximately a factor of 10). Calcipotriol is a non-steroidal antipsoriatic agent, derived from vitamin D. Calcipotriol exhibits a vitamin D-like effect by competing for the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor. Calcipotriol is as potent as 1,25(OH)2D3, the naturally occurring active form of vitamin D, in regulating cell proliferation and cell differentiation, but much less active than 1,25(OH)2D3 in its effect on calcium metabolism. Calcipotriol induces differentiation and suppresses proliferation (without any evidence of a cytotoxic effect) of keratinocytes, thus reversing the abnormal keratinocyte changes in psoriasis. The therapeutic goal envisaged with Calcipotriol is thus a normalization of epidermal growth.",The most common adverse reactions are folliculitis and burning sensation of skin.
Betamethasone,"Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Betamethasone phosphate has a short duration of action as it is rapidly hydrolyzed to betamethasone. Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces. Patients taking corticosteroids should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections.","Feeling depressed, including thinking about suicide; Feeling high (mania) or moods that go up and down; Feeling anxious, having problems sleeping, difficulty in thinking or being confused and losing your memory; Feeling, seeing or hearing things which do not exist. Having strange and frightening thoughts, changing how you act or having feelings of being alone."
Betahistine Mesylate,"Betahistine Mesilate dilates precapillary sphincters, increasing the blood flow in the inner ear. It controls the permeability of capillaries in the inner ear, thereby removing endolymphatic hydrops. It also improves cerebral circulation, increasing blood flow in the internal carotid artery. Thus, Betahistine Mesylate is clinically useful for the relief of vertigo and dizziness.Betahistine Mesilate increases microcirculation blood flow in the inner ear, and removes endolymphatic hydrops of the inner ear. It also significantly increases the blood flow of the internal carotid artery. For discomfort accompanying cerebral disturbances: Betahistine exhibits a marked healing effect on giddiness experienced upon standing, the sensation of instability, and symptoms of dizziness. The heavy feeling in the head and the accompanying discomforts can also be successfully subdued. For dizziness and the sensation of dizziness due to disturbances in the inner ear: Betahistine improves microcirculation of the inner ear and removes endolymph hydrops, thereby alleviating dizziness in Meniere's disease and Meniere's syndrome. Tinnitus, the sensation of ear obstructions, nausea and vomiting are also effectively allayed. For the prevention of dizzy spells and other residual symptoms: Along with inhibiting the symptoms of dizziness and removing residual symptoms after the attack, continued administration of Betahistine Mesylate also prevents the recurrence of dizzy spells. As the primary in prescribing for dizziness: By the combined use with antihypertensive agents, therapeutic agents for arteriosclerosis, vitamins and tranquilizers, accompanying symptoms can also be brought into remission and better therapeutic effects obtained.","Digestive: Nausea or vomiting may rarely occur. Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, such as skin rash, may rarely occur."
Betahistine Dihydrochloride,"The mechanism of action of betahistine is multifactorial. Meniere's disease is thought to result from a disruption of endolymphatic fluid homeostasis in the ear. Betahistine mainly acts as a histamine H1-receptor agonist. The stimulation of H1-receptors in the inner ear causes a vasodilatory effect leading to increased permeability of blood vessels and a reduction in endolymphatic pressure; this action prevents the rupture of the labyrinth, which can contribute to the hearing loss associated with Ménière's disease. Betahistine is also purported to act by reducing the asymmetrical functioning of sensory vestibular organs and increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow, relieving symptoms of vertigo.In addition to the above mechanisms, betahistine also acts as a histamine H3-receptor antagonist, increasing the turnover of histamine from postsynaptic histaminergic nerve receptors, subsequently leading to an increase in H1-agonist activity. H3-receptor antagonism elevates levels of neurotransmitters including serotonin in the brainstem, inhibiting the activity of vestibular nuclei, thus restoring proper balance and decreasing vertigo symptoms.","Betahistine is generally well tolerated and there is no known serious adverse effects. In some circumstances gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, rashes and pruritus have been reported."
Betacarotene + Vitamin C + Vitamin E,"Beta carotene of this tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.","β carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure."
Besifloxacin,"Besifloxacin acts against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria due to the inhibition of both bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme required for replication, transcription and repair of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV is an essential enzyme required for partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division.","The most frequently reported ocular adverse event was conjunctival redness, reported in approximately 2% of patients. Other adverse events reported in patients receiving Besifloxacin occurring in approximately 1-2% of patients included: blurred vision, eye pain, eye irritation, eye pruritus and headache."
Bepotastine Besilate,Bepotastine is direct H1-receptor antagonist and an inhibitor of the release of histamine from mast cells.,"The most common reported side effect occurring in approximately 25% of subjects was a mild taste following instillation. Other side effects occurring in 2-5% of subjects were eye irritation, headache, and nasopharyngitis."
Benzyl Penicillin,"Benzylpenicillin has a bactericidal action against gram positive bacteria, gram negative cocci, some other gram negative cross-linking stage of peptidoglycan production through binding and inactivation of transpeptidases on the inner surface of the bacterial cell membrane thus inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. It is inhibited by penicillinase and other β-lactamases.","Nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, black or hairy tongue, rash, fever, serum-like sickness, convulsions, interstitial nephritis, haemolytic anaemia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia"
Benzyl Benzoate,"Benzyl benzoate is an acaricide that is used in the treatment of scabies. Benzyl benzoate exerts toxic effects on the nervous system of the parasite, resulting in its death. It is also toxic to mite ova, though its exact mechanism of action is unknown. In vitro, benzyl benzoate has been found to kill the Sarcoptes mite within 5 minutes.","Irritant to eyes and mucous membranes, allergic dermatitis reactions, drying effects in the elderly."
Benzyl Alcohol,"Benzyl alcohol inhibits lice from closing their respiratory spiracles, allowing the vehicle to obstruct the spiracles and causing the lice to asphyxiate.","Generally well tolerated. However, a few allergic reactions may be seen. Irritation, itching, redness, tingling, or numbness at the application site may occur. However, seek immediate medical attention if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing."
Benzydamine Hydrochloride,"Benzydamine Hydrochloride mouthwash is a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) with analgesic and local anesthetic properties. The clinical pharmacology of Benzydamine mouthwash is well known. Benzydamine is poorly absorbed in the blood, thereby limiting systemic exposure to the drug when applied topically but ensures high concentration at the site of injury in mouth or throat. Therefore, it provides excellent oropharyngeal pain relief with minimal side effects. Although Benzydamine is a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory agent, it possesses a different mechanism of action that distinguishes it from conventional NSAIDs. Benzydamine mouthwash shows analgesic & anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines & reducing vascular permeability. Moreover, Benzydamine mouthwash shows local anesthetic property which provides an immediate effect on pain.","Benzydamine Hydrochloride mouthwash can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Side effects are generally minor. 

Severe allergic reaction which may include a red and lumpy skin rash, difficulty breathing, swelling of face, mouth, lips or eyelids, unexplained high temperature (fever) and feeling faint. If the swelling affects throat and makes breathing difficult and swallowing difficult, patients should be hospitalized
Itchy rash, sometimes with pale, raised areas of skin with red edges (urticaria).
A feeling of numbness in mouth.
A stinging feeling in mouth- the mouthwash may be diluted with water if you experience stinging. This should help to reduce the stinging effect."
Benzoyl Peroxide,Benzoyl peroxide has mild keratolytic effect and antimicrobial activity due to release of free-radical oxygen which oxidizes bacterial protein. It is active against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes.,"The major adverse reaction reported to date with Benzoyl Peroxide cutaneous therapy is irritation of the skin including erythema, burning, peeling, dryness, itching, stinging, feeling of skin tension locally at the site of application. This is reversible when treatment is reduced in frequency or discontinued. Allergic contact dermatitis, including face oedema, may occur."
Benzoic Acid + Salicylic Acid,"Benzoic acid: Elicits weak antifungal and antibacterial properties; also helps acidify urine.Salicylic acid: It has a potent keratolytic action and a slight antiseptic action when applied topically. It softens and destroys the stratum corneum by increasing endogenous hydration which causes the horny layer of the skin to swell, soften, and then desquamate. At high concentrations, salicylic acid has a caustic effect. It also possesses weak antifungal and antibacterial activity.","Irritation, sensitivity, excessive drying; systemic effects on prolonged use."
Benzocaine + Camphor + Methanol + Phenol,"Benzocaine binds to sodium channels and reversibly stabilizes the neuronal membrane which decreases its permeability to sodium ions. Depolarization of the neuronal membrane is inhibited thereby blocking the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses.Camphor is a naturally occurring compound that is used as a major active ingredient of balms and liniments supplied as topical analgesics. Despite its long history of common medical use, the underlying molecular mechanism of camphor action is not understood. Menthol is topically applied agents widely used for similar purposes, are known to excite and desensitize sensory nerves by acting on two members of transient receptor potential (TRP) channel superfamily: heat-sensitive TRP vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) and cold-sensitive TRP channel M8, respectively.Phenol is a potent proteolytic agent. Concentrations in the 5% to 7% range dissolve tissue on contact via proteolysis. In high concentrations when injected next to a nerve, phenol produces a chemical neurolysis which is nonselective across nerve fiber size and most prominent on its outer aspect. Local anesthetic effects occur within 5-10 minutes.","Benzocaine are more likely to cause contact sensitization. Slight burning, tingling, or stinging may occur."
Benzocaine + Butamben + Tetracaine Hydrochloride,"The onset of this topical gel-produced anesthesia is rapid (approximately 30 seconds) and the duration of anesthesia is typically 30-60 minutes, when used as directed. This effect is due to the rapid onset, but short duration of action of Benzocaine coupled with the slow onset, but extended duration of Tetracaine HCI and bridged by the intermediate action of Butamben. It is believed that all of these agents act by reversibly blocking nerve conduction. Speed and duration of action is determined by the ability of the agent to be absorbed by the mucous membrane. It will be excreted in the urine after metabolism.","Hypersensitivity Reactions: Unpredictable adverse reactions (i.e. hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis) are extremely rare. Localized allergic reactions may occur after prolonged or repeated use of any aminobenzoate anesthetic. The most common adverse reaction caused by local anesthetics is contact dermatitis characterized by erythema and pruritus that may progress to vesiculation and oozing. This occurs most commonly in patients following prolonged self-medication, which is contraindicated. If rash, urticaria, edema, or other manifestations of allergy develop during use, the drug should be discontinued. To minimize the possibility of a serious allergic reaction, this topical gel preparations should not be applied for prolonged periods except under continual supervision. Dehydration of the epithelium or an escharotic effect may also result from prolonged contact."
Yohimbine Hydrochloride,"Yohimbe is a potent alpha-2 adrenoceptor blocker and a weak alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist with some antidopaminergic properties. Yohimbe interacts with adrenoceptors that are selectively stimulated by clonidine, alpha-methylnorepinephrine, tramazoline, guanabenz & guanfacin. It also interacts with compounds that are nonselectively stimulated by norepinephrine and epinephrine. Yohimbe has a modest beneficial effect in the management of erectile dysfunction. Because of the alpha-2 adrenergic blockade, the drug is an effective treatment for sexual disorders such as decreased libido and decreased sexual response, caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.","Anxiety states, elevated blood pressure, exanthema, nausea, insomnia, tachycardia, tremor, mania and vomiting."
White Damar + Acacia + Bole Rubra,"This is a unique medicine prepared with the valuable natural ingredients, which is highly effective in the treatment of diarrhoea.

Vitamin E [Alpha Tocopherol Acetate],"Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant in the body. Vitamin E protects polyunsaturated fatty acids (which are components of cellular membrane) and other oxygen-sensitive substances such as vitamin A & vitamin C from oxidation. In premature neonates irritability, edema, thrombosis and hemolytic anemia may be caused due to vitamin E deficiency. Creatinuria, ceroid deposition, muscle weakness, decreased erythrocyte survival or increased in vitro hemolysis by oxidizing agents have been identified in adults and children with low serum tocopherol concentrations.","Overdosage (>1 gm) have been associated with minor side effects, including hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea and myopathy."
Vitamin D3 + Vitamin K1 + Vitamin K2,"Phylloquinone is often called vitamin K1. Phylloquinone is fat soluble and stable in air and moisture. However, it degrades in sunlight. It is found naturally in a wide variety of green plants. Vitamin K is needed for the post translational modification of certain proteins, mostly required for blood coagulation.Vitamin K2 is necessary for the activation of osteocalcin, a protein that transports and integrates calcium into bone to ensure a healthy skeleton. Incorporating calcium into the bone matrix means that less calcium is available for harmful deposits in soft body tissues.Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) is essential for normal bone growth & development and to maintain bone density. It also helps our body to utilize both Calcium & Phosphorus",Well tolerated in recommended dose.

The side effects include allergies, swelling in the mouth or throatetc."
Benzathine Penicillin,"Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to one or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs); which in turn inhibits the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls, thus inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis. Bacteria eventually lyse due to ongoing activity of cell wall autolytic enzymes (autolysins and murein hydrolases) while cell wall assembly is arrested.","The toxicity of penicillins is generally low, but in a small number of patients penicillin can cause sensitization and allergic reactions. Acute, lifethreatening anaphylactic reactions are rare, but they do occur. Intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin can cause moderate burning discomfort, local pain, and deep muscle soreness and tenderness at the site of injection, lasting for one to three days in about 10% of patients. Some patients had low-grade fever (102˚F) associated with local pain and tenderness. This febrile reaction disappeared within 24 to 48 hours."

Bisacodyl acts on the colon to stimulate peristalsis and on the small bowel and colon to increase intraluminal water and electrolytes. When applied to the caecum, Bisacodyl initiates a response in the entire colon.",Bisacodyl is free of side effects if taken in the recommended doses. Overuse of bisacodyl may result in diarrhea and malabsorption. Bisacodyl overuse might be expected to deplete potassium.
Biphasic Insulin Aspart [rDNA],"30% Insulin Aspart and 70% Insulin Aspart Protamine (rDNA) is a human insulin analog suspension containing 30 % soluble Insulin Aspart and 70% Insulin Aspart Protamine crystals. This is a blood glucose lowering agent with an earlier onset and an intermediate duration of action. Insulin Aspart is homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s yeast).Primary function of insulin, including Insulin Aspart, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, primarily by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.","Side effects of Insulin Aspart are hypoglycemia, lipodystrophy, weight gain, peripheral edema."
Bimatoprost + Timolol,"Bimatoprost is believed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in humans by increasing outflow of aqueous humor through both the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral routes. Bimatoprost reduces the pressure in the eye by mimicking the action of a naturally-occuring prostaglandin. Prostaglandins are a group of chemicals found in many places in the body. In the eye, they increase the drainage of the aqueous humour out of the eyeball. Bimatoprost is a synthetic compound related to one of the natural prostaglandins, and works by increasing the drainage of aqueous humour out of the eyeball. Bimatoprost may also lower the rate of aqueous formation in the eye. Both these effects decrease the pressure within the eye.Similar to propranolol and nadolol, timolol is a non-selective, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Timolol does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity, but does possess a relatively high degree of lipid solubility. Timolol, when applied topically to the eye, has the action of reducing elevated, as well as normal, intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage.","In clinical trials, Ocular hyperemia was reported in approximately 26% of patients. 5 to 10 % in these clinical studies included decreased visual acuity, eye discomfort, foreign body sensation, pain and pruritis."

Both these effects decrease the pressure within the eye.","Common side effects are: Burning/stinging/irritation/ redness/discomfort of the eye, Feeling as if something is in your eye, Dry eyes, Watering eyes, Temporary unstable vision, Increased sensitivity to light, Dizziness."
Bilastine,"Bilastine is a non-sedating, long-acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H 1 receptor antagonist affinity and no affinity for muscarinic receptors. Bilastine inhibits histamine-induced wheal and flare skin reactions for 24 hours following single doses.","The most commonly reported side effects in clinical trial are headache, dizziness, somnolence and fatigue. These adverse events occurred with a comparable frequency in patients receiving placebo."
Bicalutamide,"Bicalutamide is a non-steroidal androgen receptor inhibitor. It competitively inhibits the action of androgens by binding to cytosol androgen receptors in the target tissue. Prostatic carcinoma is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to treatment that counteracts the effect of androgen and/or removes the source of androgen.When Bicalutamide is combined with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analog therapy, the suppression of serum testosterone induced by the LHRH analog is not affected. However, in clinical trials with Bicalutamide as a single agent for prostate cancer, rises in serum testosterone and estradiol have been noted.In a subset of patients who have been treated with Bicalutamide and an LHRH agonist, and who discontinue Bicalutamide therapy due to progressive advanced prostate cancer, a reduction in Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and/or clinical improvement (antiandrogen withdrawal phenomenon) may be observed.","Anaemia; angioedema, urticaria; decreased appetite, DM, wt gain, dehydration, gout; decreased libido, depression, anxiety, hypertonia, confusion, neuropathy, nervousness, dizziness, somnolence; hot flush; abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, flatulence, anorexia, rectal haemorrhage, dry mouth, melaena; hepatotoxicity, jaundice, hypertransaminasaemia; alopecia, hirsutism, dry skin, pruritus/rash, photosensitivity; haematuria, dysuria, urinary retention, impaired urination, urinary frequency; gynaecomastia, breast tenderness, erectile dysfunction; asthenia, oedema, chest pain, neck pain, fever, sepsis, chills, neoplasm; cough, pharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, rhinitis."
Betrixaban,"Betrixaban is a factor Xa inhibitor that selectively blocks the active site of factor Xa and does not require a cofactor (such as Anti-thrombin III) for activity. Betrixaban inhibits free factor Xa and prothrombinase activity. By directly inhibiting factor Xa, Betrixaban decreases thrombin generation (TG). Betrixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation.","Most common adverse reaction is bleeding, epidural or spinal hematoma may develop during spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture."
Bevacizumab,Bevacizumab binds VEGF and prevents the interaction of VEGF to its receptors (Flt-1 and KDR) on the surface of endothelial cells. The interaction of VEGF with its receptors leads to endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation in in vitro models of angiogenesis. Administration of bevacizumab to xenotransplant models of colon cancer in nude (athymic) mice caused reduction of microvascular growth and inhibition of metastatic disease progression.,"dry mouth, cough, voice changes, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, loss of appetite, mouth sores, headache, back , pain, cold symptoms (stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat), dry or watery eyes, dry or flaky skin, hair loss, changes in your sense of taste, jaw pain/swelling/numbness, loose teeth, or gum infection."
Betaxolol Hydrochloride,"Betaxolol is a selective (beta-1-adrenergic) receptor blocking agent that does not have significant membrane stabilizing (local anesthetic) activity and is free from intrinsic sympathomimetic action. When instilled into the eye, Betaxolol reduces elevated as well as normal intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Optic nerve head damage and visual field loss are results of a sustained elevated intraocular pressure and poor ocular perfusion. The ocular hypotensive action of Betaxolol appears to be mediated by a reduction of aqueous production as demonstrated by tonography and aqueous flurophotometry. Betaxolol ophthalmic solution does not produce miosis or accommodative spasm which is frequently seen with miotic. The onset of action with Betaxolol can generally be noted within 30 minutes and the maximal effect can usually be detected two hours after topical administration. A single dose provides a 12-hour reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) and twice daily administration maintains the IOP below 22 mm Hg in most patients.","Ocular: Discomfort of short duration, occasional tearing has been reported. Rare instances of decreased corneal sensitivity, erythema, itching sensation, corneal punctuate staining, keratitis, edema and photophobia have been reported.Systemic: Systemic reactions following administration of Betaxolol hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.5% have been rarely reported. These include:

Cardiovascular: bradycardia, heart block, congestive heart failure.
Respiratory: bronchospasm, respiratory failure.
Others: Hives, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hair loss and glossitis."
Betamethasone Valerate,"Betamethasone Valerate BP is a synthetic adrenocorticosteroid, which is glucocorticoid in nature. It is an analog of prednisolone that also possesses a slight degree of mineral corticosteroid activity. Due to its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive activity, it is very effective and suitable for dermatological use. It is absorbed from the skin and inflammation and/or another disease process in the skin increase percutaneous absorption from the skin. Occlusive dressings substantially increase its percutaneous absorption.","The following local adverse reactions are more common with the use of high doses, long term use and with the use of occlusive dressings of Cream/Ointment: dryness, itching, burning, skin thinning, local irritation, features of hypercorticolism, telagiectasia, striaea, skin atrophy. hypertrichosis, change in pigmentation, secondary infection, perioral dermatiis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, acneform eruption, exacerbation of symptoms."
Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate,"Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Betamethasone phosphate has a short duration of action as it is rapidly hydrolyzed to betamethasone. Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces. Patients taking corticosteroids should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections.","Hypersensitivity reactions may occur leading to irritation, burning, stinging, itching and dermatitis. Topical corticosteroid use may result in corneal ulceration, increased intraocular pressure leading to optic nerve damage, reduced visual acuity. Intensive or prolonged use of topical corticosteroids may lead to formation of posterior subcapsular cataracts. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, corticosteroid therapy may result in thinning of the globe leading to perforation. Mydriasis, ptosis and epithelial punctate keratitis have also been reported following ophthalmic use of corticosteroids."
Betamethasone Dipropionate + Salicylic Acid,"Betamethasone Dipropionate is a glucocorticoid which have primarily anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects and Salicylic Acid which has keratolytic properties and is applied topically in the treatment of hyperkeratotic. Keratolytic action helps to facilitate the penetration of the corticosteroids easily and Betamethasone Dipropionate is an effective treatment of dermatoses because of their anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions.","Side effects that have been reported with the application of topical corticosteroids include burning, itching, irritation, dryness, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis."
Betamethasone Dipropionate,"Betamethasone Dipropionate is a topical corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. Betamethasone Dipropionate induces peptides called lipocortins. Lipocortins antagonize phospholipase A2, an enzyme that causes the breakdown of leukocyte lysosomal membranes to release arachidonic acid. This action decreases the subsequent formation and release of endogenous inflammatory mediators including prostaglandins, kinins, histamine. Pharmacokinetics: Betamethasone Dipropionate can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver.lt excreted by the kidneys.","The most frequent side effects reported with Betamethasone Dipropionate are mild to moderate transient burning/stinging, dry skin, pruritus, irritation and folliculitis. Rarely reported adverse effects include tingling, prickly skin/tightening or cracking of skin, warm feeling,laminar scaling and perilesional scaling,follicular rash, skin atrophy, erythema, urticaria, vesiculation, telangiectasia, acneiform papules and hyperaesthesia.Adverse reactions reported with the use of the Betamethasone Dipropionate ointment pulse dose regimen were mild intermittent hypertension and paraesthesia. Other local adverse reactions that have been reported with the use of topical corticosteroids include: itching, hypertrichosis, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, striae, miliaria and exacerbation of untreated infections"
Betamethasone + Neomycin Sulphate (Topical),"Betamethasone is an active topical corticosteroid, which produces a rapid response in the inflammatory dermatoses and cures psoriasis types of skin diseases. Neomycin Sulfate is a topical broad-spectrum bactericidal amino-glycoside effective against various kinds of gram-positive and gramnegative pathogens such as Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus etc. This preparation has effective penetration and uniform distribution capacity, so it is very effective in hairy and intertriginous places. This preparation is very effective for the treatment of wet ulceration of the skin.","This preparation is well tolerated. But prolonged and high doses may cause Cushing's syndrome, acne, thinning and dilatation of blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used."
Betamethasone + Phenylephrine + Lignocaine,"Betamethasone is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. It induces phospholipase A2 inhibitory lipase (lipocortins) and sequentially inhibits the release of arachidonic acid, thereby depressing the formation, release, and activity of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other inflammatory mediators.Phenylephrine is a sympathomimetic with mainly direct effects on alpha-adrenergic receptors and weak beta-adrenergic activity. It causes vasoconstriction of the arterioles of the nasal mucosa and conjunctiva; activates the dilator muscle of the pupil to cause contraction; produces vasoconstriction of arterioles in the body and produces systemic arterial vasoconstriction.Lidocaine alters signal conduction in neurons by blocking the fast voltage-gated Na+ channels in the neuronal cell membrane responsible for signal propagation. With sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential.","As with all topical corticosteroids, its use for prolonged periods, may cause systemic absorption, specially in children. Prolonged and intensive treatment with active corticosteroid preparations may also cause local atrophic changes in the skin. There are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids, and in this situation it should be discontinued. Some patients may experience burning upon application, specially if the mucous membrane is not intact."
Betamethasone + Neomycin Sulphate (E/E),"Betamethasone is a corticosteroid which is effective in inflammatory dermatoses. It is also effective in less responsive conditions such as psoriasis.  Betamethasone has a 16β-methyl group that enhances the anti-inflammatory action of the molecule and reduces the sodium and water retaining properties of the fluorine atom bound at carbon 9.Neomycin sulfate is bactericidal against many bacteria which are commonly associated with skin infections. Neomycin is a broad spectrum antibiotic which actively transported across the bacterial cell membrane, binds to a specific receptor protein on the 30s subunit of bacterial ribosomes, and interferes with an initiation complex between mRNA (messenger RNA) and the 30s subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis. DNA may be misread, thus producing nonfunctional proteins; polyribosomes are split apart and are unable to synthesize protein.","Acute sensitization to neomycin is a rare event but can occur after topical application to the eye. Eye drops containing corticosteroids cause a serious rise in intra-ocular pressure in a small percentage of the population, including most of those with a family history of glaucoma. A milder rise may be experienced by a larger proportion of subjects if treatment is continued for longer than a few weeks. Thinning of the cornea leading to perforation has occurred with use of topical corticosteroids. Cataract is reported to have occurred after unduly prolonged treatment of eye conditions with topical corticosteroids."
Betamethasone + Gentamicin,"Betamethasone dipropionate with gentamicin combines the anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive activity of a synthetic corticosteroid, betamethasone dipropionate, with the broad spectrum anti-bacterial effect of gentamicin.In secondary skin infections, gentamicin facilitates the treatment of the underlying dermatosis by controlling the infection. Bacteria susceptible to the action of gentamicin include sensitive strains of streptococci (group A beta hemolytic, alpha hemolytic), S. aureus (coagulase positive, coagulase negative, and some penicillinase producing strains), and the gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa, E. aerogenes, E. coli, Proteus (both indole positive and indole negative), K. pneumoniae, and S. marcescens.This cream is slightly acidic so that it is within the pH range of the normal skin. On application, it leaves minimum residue without stickiness or greasiness. The presence of petrolatum in both cream and ointment offers lubricating qualities and helps to prevent excessive drying.","The following local adverse skin reactions have been reported with the use of topical steroids: dryness, itching, burning, local irritation, striae, skin atrophy, hypertrichosis, change in pigmentation and secondary infection. Adrenal suppression has also been reported following topical corticosteroid therapy. Posterior subcapsular cataracts have been reported following systemic use of corticosteroids.."
Betamethasone + Clotrimazole,"Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent used for the treatment of superficial infections caused by species of pathogenic dermatophytes, yeasts and Malassezia furfur. The mechanism of action involves inhibition of the synthesis of ergosterol, a major sterol in the fungal cell membrane. This leads to instability of the cell membrane and eventual death of the fungus. Betamethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. But the exact mechanism of action of corticosteroids is not clearly known.","Adverse reactions reported for the preparation in clinical trials were paresthesia in 1.9% of patients, rash, edema and secondary infection, each in less than 1% of patients. Other adverse reactions reported with the preparation were burning and dry skin in 1.6% of patients and stinging in less than 1% of patients"
Betamethasone + Clotrimazole + Gentamicin,"This Cream combines the anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions of Betamethasone Dipropionate with the broad spectrum antifungal activity of Clotrimazole and the wide-spectrum bactericidal antibiotic activity of Gentamicin Sulfate. Clotrimazole appears to act on the fungal cell membrane, causing leakage of cell contents. Gentamicin provides highly effective topical treatment in primary and secondary bacterial infections of the skin.","Adverse reactions have been reported very rarely and include hypochromia, burning, erythema, exudation etc."

Bempedoic acid,"Bempedoic acid is an adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL) inhibitor that lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver. ACL is an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Bempedoic acid and its active metabolite, ESP15228, require coenzyme A (CoA) activation by very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSVL1) to ETC-1002-CoA and ESP15228-CoA, respectively. ACSVL1 is expressed primarily in the liver. Inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in decreased cholesterol synthesis in the liver and lowers LDL-C in blood via upregulation of low-density lipoprotein receptors.","Upper respiratory tract infection

Saccharomyces Boulardii,"Saccharomyces boulardii strain survives stomach acid to colonize in the intestinal tract while acting as a temporary flora to protect the beneficial organisms of the intestine. Additionally, it works with the body to re establish the microflora, thereby helping to maintain and support healthy immunity, digestion and gut health. It shows the following actions:Anti-toxin activity: S. boulardii produces proteins that work to neutralize bacterial toxins. This may include the toxins produced by Clostridium diffcile.Anti-microbial: S. boulardii adheres to pathogens, which decreases their adhesion to the intestinal wall and decreases invasion of enterocytes into the body. These pathogens are then removed during bowel movements.Enzymatic activity: In healthy adults, S. boulardii increases the enzymatic activities (lactase, alpha glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase). The production of intestinal polyamines by S. boulardii is one of its most relevant and specific mechanisms of action. The polyamines spermidine, spermine, and putrescine enhance the expression of brush border enzymes (such as hydrolases, proteases, and transport molecules).Immune Enhancement: S. boulardii helps prevent infection by stimulating the immune system along the GI lining by increasing the protective antibody IgA.Anti-inflammatory: S. boulardii causes a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines.",Saccharomyces boulardii is likely safe for most adults when taken by mouth. It can cause gas in some people.

This tablet tones up and restores the normal functions of uterus, prevents urinary discharge; particularly useful for watery discharge from vagina. It is also very effective in leucorrhoea and menstrual irregularity.",No significant side effect has been observed in proper dosage.
Azithromycin Dihydrate,"Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:

Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes
Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae
Other microorganisms: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.
Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci
Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila
Anaerobic microorganisms: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia","Azithromycin is well tolerated with a low incidence of side effects. The side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), flatulence, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, and skin rashes and are reversible upon discontinuation of therapy."
Azilsartan Medoxomil + Chlorthalidone,"Azilsartan medoxomil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Azilsartan helps blood vessels to dilate. It also helps to excrete of Sodium and water from body. This combination also contains a diuretic. Chlorthalidone works in the kidneys to flush excess water and salt (sodium) from the body. Together, these 2 medicines work to help lower blood pressure in people who need more than 1 medicine to treat their high blood pressure (hypertension).","The following potential adverse reactions are-

Bromhexine Hydrochloride,"Bromhexine Hydrochloride is an oral mucolytic agent. It disrupts the structure of acid mucopolysaccharide fibres in mucoid sputum and produces less viscous mucus, which makes easier the expectoration. It is rapidly & completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is widely distributed into the body tissues.","Gastrointestinal side effects may occur occasionally. A transient rise in serum aminotransferase values has been reported. Other reported side effects include-headache, vertigo (dizziness) and allergic reactions."
Bromfenac Sodium,"Bromfenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity is thought to be due to its ability to block prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase 1 and 2. Prostaglandins have been shown in many animal models to be mediators of certain kinds of intraocular inflammation. In studies performed in animal eyes, prostaglandins have been shown to produce disruption of the blood-aqueous humor barrier, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, leukocytosis and increased intraocular pressure.","The most commonly reported adverse reactions following use of Bromfenac after cataract surgery include: abnormal sensation in eye, conjunctival hyperemia, eye irritation (including burning/stinging), eye pain, eye pruritus, eye redness, headache and iritis. These events were reported in 2-7% of patients"
Bromelain + Trypsin,"Trypsin is an enzyme. An enzyme is a protein that speeds up a certain biochemical reaction. Trypsin is found in the small intestine. It can also be made from fungus, plants, and bacteria. But it is usually made for commercial purposes from the pancreas of livestock. Trypsin is given to people who lack enzymes needed for digestion. It is also given in combination with bromelain and rutin for treatment of osteoarthritis.Bromelain is a protein extract derived from the stems of pineapples, although it exists in all parts of the fresh plant and fruit. The extract has a history of folk medicine use. As a culinary ingredient, it may be used as a meat tenderizer. The term ""bromelain"" may refer to either of two protease enzymes extracted from the plants of the family Bromeliaceae, or it may refer to a combination of those enzymes along with other compounds produced in an extract.",Trypsin seems to be safe when used by healthcare professionals for wound cleaning and healing. It can cause side effects such as pain and burning. Not enough is known about the safety of trypsin for its other uses.
Bromazepam,"Bromazepam is a powerful psychotropic agent. In lower dosage, it selectively reduces tension and anxiety. In higher dosage, it shows sedative and muscle-relaxant properties. Bromazepam binds to the GABA-A receptor producing a conformational change and potentiating its inhibitory effects. Other neurotransmitters are not influenced.","Common side-effects include fatigue, drowsiness, muscle weakness, numbed muscle, reduced alertness, confusion, headache, ataxia etc. These phenomena occur predominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear with prolonged administration. Anterograde amnesia may occur using therapeutic doses."
Brivaracetam,"The precise mechanism by which Brivaracetam exerts its anticonvulsant activity is not known. Brivaracetam displays a high and selective affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) in the brain, which may contribute to the anticonvulsant effect.Brivaracetam binds SV2A with high affinity. SV2A is known to play a role in epileptogenesis through modulation of synaptic GABA release. It is thought that brivaracetam exerts its anti-epileptogenic effects through its binding to SV2A. Brivaracetam is also known to inhibit Na+ channels which may also contribute to its anti-epileptogenic action","Most common adverse reactions (at least 5% for Brivaracetam and at least 2% more frequently than placebo) are somnolence/sedation, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea or vomiting."
Brinzolamide + Brimonidine Tartrate,Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor which reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing aqueous humor secretion in the ciliary processes of the eye. Brimonidine Tartrate is an alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist which reduces IOP by decreasing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow.,"The most commonly reported side effects include blurred vision, eye irritation, bad taste and dry mouth."
Brinzolamide + Timolol,"Brinzolamide is a highly specific inhibitor of CA-II, which is the main CA isoenzyme involved in the secretion of aqueous humor. Inhibition of CA in the ciliary process of the eye slows the formation of bicarbonate, and reduces sodium and fluid transport. This results in a reduction in the rate of aqueous humor secretion and the intraocular pressure. Brinzolamide is absorbed systemically following topical ocular administration. Since it has a high affinity for CA-II, brinzolamide binds extensively to red blood cells, where CA-II is primarily found. As sufficient CA-II activity remains, adverse effects resulting from the systemic inhibition of CA by brinzolamide are not observed. The metabolite N-desethyl brinzolamide is also formed. This metabolite binds to CA and accumulates in red blood cells as well. In the presence of brinzolamide, the metabolite binds mainly to carbonic anhydrase I (CA-I).Like propranolol and nadolol, timolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and beta(2)-receptors in the bronchial and vascular smooth muscle. Beta(1)-receptor blockade results in a decrease in resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and, possibly, a reduction in reflex orthostatic hypotension. Beta(2)-blockade results in an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. The exact mechanism whereby timolol reduces ocular pressure is still not known. The most likely action is by decreasing the secretion of aqueous humor.","Dysgeusia, blurred vision, eye pain & irritation, foreign body sensation."
Brinzolamide,"Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body including the eye. It catalyses the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. It exists as a number of isoenzymes, the most active being carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II), found primarily in red blood cells, but also in other tissues. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fuid transport. Following topical ocular administration, brinzolamide inhibits aqueous humor formation and reduces elevated intraocular pressure. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual feld loss.","Reported side effects are blurred vision and bitter, sour or unusual taste. Other side effects are blepharitis, dermatitis, dry eye, foreign body sensation, headache, hyperemia, ocular discharge, ocular discomfort, ocular keratitis, ocular pain, ocular pruritus and rhinitis."
Brimonidine Tartrate + Timolol Maleate,"This eye drops is comprised of two components: Brimonidine Tartrate & Timolol Maleate. Brimonidine Tartrate is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist having a dual mechanism of action. It decreases aqueous humor production and increases nonpressure dependent uveoscleral outflow. Timolol Maleate is a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. It lowers IOP by reducing aqueous humor production. Therefore the combination of both drugs gives a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen within two hours of administration.","The most common side effects are allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival folliculosis, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye pruritus and ocular burning or stinging."
Brimonidine Tartrate,Brimonidine is an α-2 adrenoreceptor agonist that is more selective for the α-2 adrenoreceptor than α-1. Topical administration of Brimonidine Tartrate eye drops decreases intraocular pressure (IOP) in humans. When used as directed Brimonidine Tartrate have the action of reducing elevated IOP with minimal effect on cardiovascular parametres. Brimonidine Tartrate eye drops have a rapid onset of action with the peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing. The duration of effect is 12 hours or greater. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that Brimonidine Tartrate has a dual mechanism of action. Brimonidine Tartrate eye drops lower IOP by reducing aqueous humor production and enhancing uveoscleral outflow.,"Adverse events occurring in approximately 10-30% of the subjects, in descending order of incidence, included oral dryness, ocular hyperemia, burning and stinging, headache, blurring, foreign body sensation, fatigue/drowsiness, conjunctival follicles, ocular allergic reactions, and ocular pruritus. Events occurring in approximately 3-9% of the subjects, in descending order included corneal staining/erosion, photophobia, eyelid erythema, ocular ache/pain, ocular dryness, tearing, upper respiratory symptoms, eyelid edema, conjunctival edema, dizziness, blepharitis, ocular irritation, gastrointestinal symptoms, asthenia, conjunctival blanching, abnormal vision and muscular pain. The following adverse reactions were reported in less than 3% of the patients: lid crusting, conjunctival hemorrhage, abnormal taste, insomnia, conjunctival discharge, depression, hypertension, anxiety, palpitations/arrhythmias, nasal dryness and syncope."
Brigatinib,"Brigatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity at clinically achievable concentrations against multiple kinases including ALK, ROS1, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and FLT-3 as well as EGFR deletion and point mutations. Brigatinib inhibited autophosphorylation of ALK and ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling proteins STAT3, AKT, ERK1/2, and S6 in in-vitro and in vivo assays. Brigatinib also inhibited the in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing EML4-ALK and NPM ALK fusion proteins and demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC xenograft growth in mice. Brigatinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of the pharmacodynamic response are unknown.Absorption: Following administration of single oral doses of Brigatinib of 30 to 240 mg, the median time to peak concentration (Tmax) ranged from 1 to 4 hours.Distribution: Brigatinib is 66% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is not concentration-dependent in vitro. The blood to plasma concentration ratio is 0.69. Following oral administration of Brigatinib 180 mg once daily, the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of Brigatinib at steady-state was 153 L.Elimination: Following oral administration of Brigatinib 180 mg once daily, the mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of Brigatinib at steady-state is 12.7 L/h and the mean plasma elimination half-life is 25 hours.Metabolism: Brigatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 in vitro. Following oral administration of a single 180 mg dose of radiolabeled Brigatinib to healthy subjects, N-demethylation and cysteine conjugation were the two major metabolic pathways. Unchanged Brigatinib (92%) and its primary metabolite, AP26123 (3.5%), were the major circulating radioactive components. The steady-state AUC of AP26123 was less than 10% of AUC of Brigatinib exposure in patients. The metabolite, AP26123, inhibited ALK with approximately 3-fold lower potency than Brigatinib in vitro.Excretion: Following oral administration of a single 180 mg dose of radiolabeled Brigatinib to healthy subjects, 65% of the administered dose was recovered in feces and 25% of the administered dose was recovered in urine. Unchanged Brigatinib represented 41% and 86% of the total radioactivity in feces and urine, respectively.","Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis

Bortezomib,"Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro. Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma.","Most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥30%) in clinical studies include asthenic conditions, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, peripheral neuropathy, vomiting, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, psychiatric disorders, anorexia and decreased appetite, neutropenia, neuralgia, leukopenia and anemia. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported"
Bosentan Monohydrate,"Bosentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with affinity for both endothelin A and B (ETA and ETB) receptors. Bosentan decreases both pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance resulting in increased cardiac output without increasing heart rate.The neurohormone endothelin-1 (ET-1) is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors known and can also promote fibrosis, cell proliferation, cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling, and is pro-inflammatory. These effects are mediated by endothelin binding to ETA and ETB receptors located in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells. ET-1 concentrations in tissues and plasma are increased in several cardiovascular disorders and connective tissue diseases, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, scleroderma, acute and chronic heart failure, myocardial ischaemia, systemic hypertension and atherosclerosis, suggesting a pathogenic role of ET-1 in these diseases. In pulmonary arterial hypertension and heart failure, in the absence of endothelin receptor antagonism, elevated ET-1 concentrations are strongly correlated with the severity and prognosis of these diseases","Treatment with bosentan has been associated with dose dependent elevations in liver aminotransferases and decreases in haemoglobin concentration. Other side effects include Anaemia, haemoglobin decrease, Thrombocytopenia, Neutropenia, leucopenia, Hypersensitivity reactions, Headache, Syncope, Palpitations, Flushing, Hypotension, Gastroesophageal reflux disease, Aminotransferase elevations associated with hepatitis and/or jaundice, Liver cirrhosis, liver failure (rarely), Erythema, Diarrhoea, Oedema, fluid retention."
Bleomycin Sulfate,"Although the exact mechanism of action of bleomycin sulfate is unknown, available evidence indicates that the main mode of action is the inhibition of DNA synthesis with some evidence of lesser inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis.Bleomycin is known to cause single, and to a lesser extent, double-stranded breaks in DNA. In in vitro and in vivo experiments, bleomycin has been shown to cause cell cycle arrest in G2 and in mitosis. When administered into the pleural cavity in the treatment of malignant pleural effusion, bleomycin sulfate acts as a sclerosing agent.","Common side effects of Bleomycin Sulfate include injection site reactions (pain, redness, warmth, itching, or swelling), fever, chills, vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss, darkening or discoloration of the skin, changes in fingernails or toenails, itching, or pain near your tumor."
Bivalirudin,"Bivalirudin directly inhibits thrombin by specifically binding both to the catalytic site and to the anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin. Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release. The binding of bivalirudin to thrombin is reversible as thrombin slowly cleaves the bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 bond, resulting in recovery of thrombin active site functions.In in vitro studies, bivalirudin inhibited both soluble (free) and clot-bound thrombin, was not neutralized by products of the platelet release reaction, and prolonged the activated partialthromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin time (PT) of normal human plasma in a concentration-dependent manner. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.","Bleeding, Body as a Whole: fever,infection, sepsis;
Cardiovascular: hypotension, syncope, vascular anomaly,ventricular fibrillation;
Nervous: cerebral ischemia, confusion, facialparalysis;
Respiratory: lung edema;
Urogenital: kidney failure, oliguria."
Bisoprolol Hemifumarate,"Bisoprolol Hemifumarate is the most selective ß1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the ß1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks ß1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by ß-blockers, in patients with non-ß1 selective ß1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.","Bisoprolol, like any medication, may have some side effects. It is important that you keep your doctor informed of all side effects especially if you experience one of the following for several days. The most common side effects, whether or not caused by Bisoprolol, are: headache, fatigue, urinary tract infection, rhinitis or sinusitis (inflammation in the nose), diarrhea, dizziness, peripheral edema (swelling of the ankles), joint pain, cough, insomnia (trouble sleeping), nausea (feeling like vomiting), and sore throat. You must seek medical attention immediately if you experience an allergic reaction with symptoms of rash, itching, swelling, dizziness or trouble breathing. Medicines affect different people in different ways. Just because side effects have occurred in other patients does not mean you will get them. Discuss how you feel on Bisoprolol with your doctor or pharmacist. Do not stop or restart Bisoprolol on your own."
Bisoprolol Fumarate + Hydrochlorothiazide,Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide have been used individually and in combination for the treatment of hypertension. The antihypertensive effects of these agents are additive; Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg significantly increases the antihypertensive effect of Bisoprolol Fumarate. The incidence of hypokalemia with the Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg combination is significantly lower than with Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Bisoprolol Fumarate is a β1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent without significant membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic activities in its therapeutic dose range. Hydrochlorothiazide is a benzothiadiazine diuretic. Thiazides affect renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption and increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts,"Generally well tolerated. Most side effects have been mild and transient. Side effects which may occur: fatigue, dizziness, headache, bradycardia, arrhythmia, peripheral ischemia, chest pain, palpitations, rhythm disturbances, cold extremities, claudication, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, rhinitis, pharyngitis etc."
Bisoprolol Fumarate + Amlodipine Besilate,"This consists of Amlodipine and Bisoprolol Fumarate. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine acts directly on vessels to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.Bisoprolol Fumarate is a synthetic, beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent, lacking intrinsic sympathomimetic and relevant membrane stabilizing activity. It only shows low affinity to the beta2 receptor of the smooth muscles of bronchi and vessels as well as to the beta2-receptors concerned with metabolic regulation. Therefore, bisoprolol is generally not to be expected to influence airway resistance and beta2-mediated metabolic effects. Its beta1-selectivity extends beyond the therapeutic dose range.","Common: Dizziness, headache, somnolence, palpitations, flushing, feeling of coldness or numbness in the extremities, gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain; edema (e.g. ankle edema), fatigue. Uncommon: Insomnia, mood changes (incl. anxiety), depression, sleep disorders, hypaesthesia, paresthesia, dysgeusia, tremor, visual disturbances (incl. diplopia), tinnitus, AV conduction disturbances, worsening of pre existing heart failure, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope, dyspnea, bronchospasm in patients with bronchial asthma or a history of obstructive airway disease, rhinitis, dyspepsia, dry mouth, alopecia, purpura, skin discoloration, pruritus, exanthema, arthralgia, myalgia, muscular weakness, muscle cramps, back pain, micturition disorder, nocturia, pollakisuria, potency disorders, gynecomastia, asthenia, chest pain, pain, malaise, weight increase, weight decrease. Rare: Allergic reactions mainly affecting the skin, nightmares, hallucinations, confusion, decreased tear secretion, hearing disorders, allergic rhinitis, hepatitis, increased triglycerides, increased liver enzymes (ALAT, ASAT)."
Bismuth Subsalicylate,"Antacid action: Bismuth Subsalicylate coats ulcer surface, protecting it from acid and pepsin. It stimulates mucus and bicarbonate secretion and also reacts with HCl, produces bismuth oxychloride and salicylic acid thus reduces HCl.Anti-diarrheal action: It stimulates absorption of water and electrolytes across the intestinal wall. In infectious diarrhea it binds with toxin produced by E.coli, disrupts cell, causing lysis of H.pylori and prevents adhesion of H.pylori in the cell wall of intestine.Anti-inflammatory action: When hydrolyzed to salicylic acid, it inhibits prostaglandin G/H synthase ½. Thus reduces inflammation and Coats the irritated tissue to retard the expulsion of fluid.","Black stool and black tongue is common with use of Bismuth Subsalicylate. Bismuth Subsalicylate should not be used if symptoms are severe or persist for more than 2 days. Do not exceed the recommended dose, shake the bottle before use. For oral use only."
Azilsartan Medoxomil,"Azilsartan Medoxomil, a prodrug, is hydrolyzed to Azilsartan in the gastrointestinal tract during absorption. Azilsartan is a selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Azilsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland.","The most common adverse reaction in adults is diarrhea. The other side effects are nausea, asthenia, fatigue, muscle spasm, dizziness and cough."
Azelastine Hydrochloride + Fluticasone Propionate,"Azelastine Hydrochloride exhibits histamine H1-receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H1-receptor antagonist activity. Fluticasone Propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. The precise mechanism through which Fluticasone Propionate affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes etc.) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation.","The most common adverse reactions (>2% incidence) are: dysgeusia, epistaxis, and headache."
Azelastine Hydrochloride (Nasal Spray),"Azelastine, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H1 receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models and humans. It is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in invitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H1-receptor antagonist activity.","Headache, dizziness, sneezing, nosebleed, nausea, stinging or itching in nose, dry mouth, sore throat, bitter taste etc."

Aspirin + Dipyridamole,"This is a combination of anti-platelet agents Aspirin & Dipyridamole intended for oral administration. Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A2. Dipyridamole inhibits platelet aggregation by inhibiting the uptake of adenosine into platelet, which is a potent mediator of vasodilation. Dipyridamole increases local concentration of adenosine which increases cAMP (cyclic-adenosine monophosphate) level thus decreased ca++ concentration and inhibits platelet aggregation. Dipyridamole also inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) especially cyclic-guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), which increases cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor) Nitric oxide a potent vasodilator.","The most frequently reported adverse reactions are headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea."
Aspirin,"By decreasing platelet aggregation, Aspirin inhibits thrombus formation on the arterial side of the circulation, where thrombi are formed by platelet aggregation and anticoagulants have little effect. Aspirin is the analgesic of choice for headache, transient musculoskeletal pain and dysmenorrhoea. It has anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, which may be useful. Enteric-coated Aspirin reduces intestinal disturbance and gastrointestinal ulceration due to aspirin.","Side effects for the usual dosage of Aspirin are mild including nausea, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal ulceration and bronchospasm etc."
Calcipotriol Monohydrate,"Calcipotriol is a non-steroidal antipsoriatic agent, derived from vitamin D. Calcipotriol exhibits a vitamin D-like effect by competing for the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor. Calcipotriol is as potent as 1,25(OH)2D3, the naturally occurring active form of vitamin D, in regulating cell proliferation and cell differentiation, but much less active than 1,25(OH)2D3 in its effect on calcium metabolism. Calcipotriol induces differentiation and suppresses proliferation (without any evidence of a cytotoxic effect) of keratinocytes, thus reversing the abnormal keratinocyte changes in psoriasis. The therapeutic goal envisaged with calcipotriol is thus a normalization of epidermal growth.","Photosensitivity reactions, skin discolouration, bullous eruption, skin exfoliation, contact dermatitis and allergic reactions have been reported with topical calcipotriol therapy."
Calamine + Zinc Oxide + Glycerine,"Calamine has mild astringent and antipruritic actions. Zinc oxide has astringent, soothing and protective properties and is used in topical preparations for eczema, slight excoriations, wounds and haemorrhoids. It also reflects ultraviolet radiation and can be used as a physical sunscreen.","A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, seek immediate medical attention if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing."
Caffeine Citrate,"Caffeine is structurally related to other methylxanthines, theophylline and theobromine. It is a bronchial smooth muscle relaxant, a CNS stimulant, a cardiac muscle stimulant and a diuretic. Although the mechanism of action of caffeine in apnea of prematurity is not known, several mechanisms have been hypothesized. These include:

stimulation of the respiratory center,
increased minute ventilation,
the decreased threshold to hypercapnia,
increased response to hypercapnia,
increased skeletal muscle tone,
decreased diaphragmatic fatigue,
increased metabolic rate,
increased oxygen consumption.

Most of these effects have been attributed to antagonism of adenosine receptors, both A1 and A2 subtypes, by caffeine","Few cases of sepsis, hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, gastritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, acidosis, cerebral hemorrhage, dyspnea, lung edema, dry skin, rash, skin breakdown, kidney failure were reported."
Cabozantinib,"In vitro biochemical and/or cellular assays have shown that Cabozantinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of MET, VEGFR-1, -2 and -3, AXL, RET, ROS1, TYRO3, MER, KIT, TRKB, FLT-3, and TIE-2. These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, drug resistance, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment.Absorption: Median time to peak cabozantinib concentrations (Tmax) ranged from 3 to 4 hours post-dose. A 19% increase in the Cmax of Cabozantinib compared to a Cabozantinib capsule formulation was observed following a single 140 mg dose. A less than 10% difference in the AUC was observed between Cabozantinib and a Cabozantinib capsule formulation.Distribution: The oral volume of distribution (Vz/F) of Cabozantinib is approximately 319 L. Cabozantinib is highly protein-bound in human plasma (≥99.7%).Elimination: The predicted terminal half-life is approximately 99 hours and the clearance (CL/F) at steady state is estimated to be 2.2 L/hr.Metabolism: Cabozantinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 in vitro.Excretion: Approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered within a 48-day collection period following a single dose of radiolabeled 14 C- Cabozantinib in healthy subjects. Approximately 54% was recovered in feces and 27% in urine. Unchanged Cabozantinib accounted for 43% of the total radioactivity in feces and was not detectable in urine following a 72-hour collection.","Hemorrhage

Cabergoline,Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist with a high affinity for D2 receptors. It works by reducing the amount of prolactin that is released from pituitary gland. Results of in vitro studies demonstrate that Cabergoline exerts a direct inhibitory effect on the secretion of prolactin.,"Pathological gambling, increased libido, and hypersexuality have been reported in patients treated with dopamine agonists including cabergoline. This has been generally reversible upon reduction of the dose or treatment discontinuation."
Cabazitaxel,"Cabazitaxel is a microtubule inhibitor. Cabazitaxel binds to tubulin and promotes its assembly into microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting disassembly. This leads to the stabilization of microtubules, which results in the interference of mitotic and interphase cellular functions. The cell is then unable to progress further into the cell cycle, being stalled at metaphase, thus triggering apoptosis of the cancer cell.","Most commonly in all grades, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea. Most commonly in ≥3 grade, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea."
Butoconazole Nitrate,"The exact mechanism of the antifungal action of butoconazole is unknown, however, it is presumed to function as other imidazole derivatives via inhibition of steroid synthesis. Imidazoles generally inhibit the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol via the inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome P450 14α-demethylase, resulting in a change in fungal cell membrane lipid composition. This structural change alters cell permeability and, ultimately, results in the osmotic disruption or growth inhibition of the fungal cell.","Of the 314 patients treated with Butoconazole for 1 day in controlled clinical trials, 18 patients (5.7%) reported complaints such as vulvar/vaginal burning, itching, soreness and swelling, pelvic or abdominal pain or cramping, or a combination of two or more of these symptoms. In 3 patients (1%) these complaints were considered treatment-related. Five of the 18 patients reporting adverse events discontinued the study because of them."
Butenafine Hydrochloride,"Butenafine is a synthetic antifungal agent that is structurally and pharmacologically related to allylamine antifungals. The exact mechanism of action has not been established, but it is suggested that butenafine's antifungal activity is exerted through the alteration of cellular membranes, which results in increased membrane permeability, and growth inhibition. Butenafine is mainly active against dermatophytes and has superior fungicidal activity against this group of fungi when compared to that of terbinafine, naftifine, tolnaftate, clotrimazole, and bifonazole. It is also active against Candida albicans and this activity is superior to that of terbinafine and naftifine. Butenafine also generates low MICs for Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus spp. as well.",Rarely local mild burning or irritation may be experienced. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
Butamirate Citrate,Butamirate Citrate acts directly on the brain's cough center to suppress cough. Butamirate Citrate is safe and non-sedating which is neither chemically nor pharmacologically related to opium alkaloids. Butamirate Citrate is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Maximum concentration is reached within 9 hours with the sustained-release tablet. This is extremely protein-bound and plasma elimination half-life is about 13 hours. The active metabolites of Butamirate Citrate have also antitussive action.,"Tolerance of Butamirate Citrate is good.Adverse reactions such as rash,nausea,diarrhoea and vertigo have been observed in a few rare cases,resolving after dose reduction or treatment withdrawal."
Busulfan,"Busulfan is an alkylating agent that contains 2 labile methanesulfonate groups attached to opposite ends of a 4-carbon alkyl chain. Once busulfan is hydrolyzed, the methanesulfonate groups are released and carbonium ions are produced. These carbonium ions alkylate DNA, which results in the interference of DNA replication and RNA transcription, ultimately leading to the disruption of nucleic acid function. Specifically, its mechanism of action through alkylation produces guanine-adenine intrastrand crosslinks. This occurs through an SN2 reaction in which the relatively nucleophilic guanine N7 attacks the carbon adjacent to the mesylate leaving group. This kind of damage cannot be repaired by cellular machinery and thus the cell undergoes apoptosis.","Bone marrow depression, manifested as leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia; hyperpigmentation, GI disturbances, impaired fertility and gonadal function. Rarely, dry skin, gynaecomastia, cataract formation, at high doses, CNS effects including convulsions."
Bupropion Hydrochloride,"Bupropion is a selective inhibitor of the neuronal re-uptake of catecholamines (noradrenaline and dopamine) with minimal effect on the re-uptake of indolamines (serotonin) and does not inhibit monoamine oxidase. While the mechanism of action of bupropion, as with other antidepressants is unknown, it is presumed that this action is mediated by noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic mechanisms.","Agitation, anxiety, and insomnia often occur during the initial stages of Bupropion therapy. Other relatively common side effects reported with Bupropion include fever, dry mouth, headache or migraine, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, tremor, sweating, and skin rashes. Hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from pruritus and urticaria, less commonly, angio-oedema, dyspnoea, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported."
Bupivacaine Hydrochloride + Dextrose,Bupivacaineis a long acting anaesthetic agent of the amide type. Bupivacaine & Dextrosehas a rapid onset of action and long duration. The duration of analgesia in the T10-T12 segments is 2-3 hours. Bupivacaine Hydrochloride produces a moderate muscular relaxation of the lower extremities lasting 2-2.5 hours. The motor blockade of the abdominal muscles makes the solution suitable for performance of abdominal surgery lasting 45-60 minutes.,"The adverse reaction profile for Bupivacaine is similar to those for other long acting local anesthetics administered intrathecally. Adverse reactions caused by the drug are difficult to distinguish from the physiological effects of the nerve block (e.g. decrease in blood pressure, bradycardia, temporary urinary retention), events caused directly (e.g. nerve trauma) or indirectly (e.g. epidural abscess) by the needle puncture or events associated to cerebrospinal leakage (eg. postdural puncture headache)."
Bupivacaine Hydrochloride,"Bupivacaine binds to the intracellular portion of voltage-gated sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization. Without depolarization, no initiation or conduction of a pain signal can occur.The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine and other local anesthetics is dependent upon the dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the preparation.

Bumetanide,"Bumetanide is a loop diuretic of the sulfamyl category to treat heart failure. It is often used in patients in whom high doses of furosemide are ineffective. There is however no reason not to use bumetanide as a first choice drug. The main difference between the two substances is in bioavailability. It is said to be a more predictable diuretic, meaning that the predictable absorption is reflected in a more predictable effect. Bumetanide is 40 times more potent than furosemide (for patients with normal renal function).Bumetanide interferes with renal cAMP and/or inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase pump. Bumetanide appears to block the active reabsorption of chloride and possibly sodium in the ascending loop of Henle, altering electrolyte transfer in the proximal tubule. This results in excretion of sodium, chloride, and water and, hence, diuresis.","The side effects of Bumetanide include: headache, dizziness, fatigue, postural hypotension and gastrointestinal symptoms. Various skin reactions, photosensitivity reactions and metabolic disturbances, including reduced glucose tolerance are less frequent. Electrolyte disturbances can occur especially during long term treatment."
Budesonide + Formoterol Fumarate,"Budesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.","Budesonide: Hoarseness, and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: Tremor, palpitations, and headache have been reported. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps, and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema, and angio-oedema, may occur in some patients."

Bromocriptine Mesylate,"Bromocriptine mesilate is a nonhormonal, nonestrogenic agent that inhibits the secretion of prolactin in humans, with little or no effect on other pituitary hormones, except in patients with acromegaly, where it lowers elevated blood levels of growth hormone. Bromocriptine mesilate is a dopamine receptor agonist, which activates post-synaptic dopamine receptors.The dopaminergic neurons in the tuberoinfundibular process modulate the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary by secreting a prolactin inhibitory factor (thought to be dopamine); in the corpus striatum the dopaminergic neurons are involved in the control of motor function. Clinically, it significantly reduces plasma levels of prolactin in patients with physiologically elevated prolactin as well as in patients with hyperprolactinemia.","Side effects in decreasing order of frequency are: nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, lightheadedness, vomiting, abdominal cramps, nasal congestion constipation, diarrhea and drowsiness. A slight hypotensive effect may accompany treatment. The occurrence of adverse reactions may be lessened by temporarily reducing dosage to 0.5 mg. Abnormalities in laboratory tests may include elevations in blood urea nitrogen, SGOT, SGPT, GGPT, CPK, alkaline phosphatase and uric acid,which are usually transient and not of clinical significance"
Aspartame,"Aspartame is a low-calorie sweetener used to sweeten a wide variety of low- and reduced-calorie foods and beverages, including low-calorie tabletop sweeteners. Aspartame is composed of two amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine, as the methyl ester. Aspartic acid and phenylalanine are also found naturally in protein containing foods, including meats, grains and dairy products. Methyl esters are also found naturally in many foods such as fruits and vegetable and their juices. Upon digestion, aspartame breaks down into three components (aspartic acid, phenylalanine and methanol), which are then absorbed into the blood and used in normal body processes. Neither aspartame nor its components accumulates in the body. These components are used in the body in the same ways as when they are derived from common foods.Aspartame is 180 to 200 times sweeter than sucrose, it is metabolized as a protein and its subsequent amino-acids used up in there respective mechanisms.","Constipation; faecal impaction; haemorrhoids; abdominal discomfort or pain; heartburn; flatulence; nausea; vomiting; diarrhoea; increased bleeding tendency (chronic use); osteoporosis; steatorrhoea (high doses); skin rashes; pruritus of the tongue, skin and perianal region; hyperchloraemic acidosis."
Articaine Hydrochloride + Epinephrine,"Articaine is an amide local anesthetic. Local anesthetics block the generation and conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of the affected nerve fibers. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor added to articaine to slow absorption into the general circulation and thus prolong maintenance of an active tissue concentration.","Common side effects include Pain, headache, facial edema, gingivitis, paresthesia, infection. Other side effects include pain, headache, positive blood aspiration into syringe, swelling, face edema, infection, neck pain, abdominal pain, ear pain, taste perversion, and accidental injury have been reportedGastrointestinal side effects including nausea and emesis, gingivitis, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, glossitis, gum hemorrhage, mouth ulceration, nausea, stomatitis, tongue edema, tooth disorder, and vomiting have been reported.Musculoskeletal side effects including trismus, arthralgia, myalgia, back pain, and osteomyelitis have been reported.General side effects including sleepiness, malaise, and asthenia have been reported.Nervous system side effects including paresthesia, numbness and tingling, dizziness, dry mouth, facial paralysis, hyperesthesia, increased salivation, nervousness, neuropathy, paresthesia, somnolence, and exacerbation of Kearns-Sayre syndrome have been reported.Cardiovascular side effects including palpitation, hemorrhage, migraine, syncope, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure have been reported.Respiratory side effects including pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinus pain, and sinus congestion have been reported."
Artesunate,"Artesunate is metabolized to the active DHA. the endoperoxide bridge of DHA reacts with heme, generating free radicals which inhibit protein and nucleic acid synthesis of the Plasmodium parasites during all erythrocytic stages. Reactions with these free radicals can also lead to alkylation of parasitic proteins such as a calcium adenosine triphosphatase and EXP1, a glutathione S-transferase.",Artesunate tablet is well tolerated. No adverse effects have been reported from the treatment of artesunate at recommended dose.

Khakshi is immunostimulant, demulcent, alterative, analgesic & hepatoprotective.",No significant side effect has been observed in proper dosage.
Anastrozole,"Anastrazole exerts its anti-estrogenic effects via selective and competitive inhibition of the aromatase enzyme found predominantly in the adrenal glands, liver, and fatty tissues. Many breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive, meaning their growth is stimulated and/or maintained by the presence of hormones such as estrogen or progesterone. In postmenopausal women, estrogen is primarily derived from the conversion of adrenally-produced androgens into estrogens by the aromatase enzyme- by competitively inhibiting the biosynthesis of estrogen at these enzymes, anastrozole effectively suppresses circulating estrogen levels and, subsequently, the growth of hormone receptor-positive tumours.","Very common side effects: Hot flushes, asthenia, joint stiffness, arthritis, headache, nausea, rash etc. Common side effects: Hair thinning, allergic reactions, diarrhea, vomiting, somnolence etc."
Ampicillin Sodium,Ampicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to 1 or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which in turn inhibit the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls. Bacteria eventually lyse due to ongoing activity of cell wall autolytic enzymes (autolysins and murein hydrolases) while cell wall assembly is arrested.,"Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, erythematous maculo-papular rashes, sore mouth, black/hairy tongue, rash, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, fever, joint pains, serum sickness-like symptoms, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, neutropenia, coagulation disorders, prolonged bleeding time and prothrombin time, CNS toxicity (e.g. convulsions); paraesthesia, nephropathy, interstitial nephritis, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, moderate and transient increase in transaminases, Anaphylaxis, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD)."
Amphotericin B,"Amphotericin B is fungistatic or fungicidal depending on the concentration obtained in body fluids and the susceptibility of the fungus. The drug acts by binding to sterols (ergosterol) in the cell membrane of susceptible fungi. This creates a transmembrane channel, and the resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components. Ergosterol, the principal sterol in the fungal cytoplasmic membrane, is the target site of action of amphotericin B and the azoles. Amphotericin B, a polyene, binds irreversibly to ergosterol, resulting in disruption of membrane integrity and ultimately cell death.","Common side effects are Fever, chills, convulsions, malaise; nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia; tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss; hypotension, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias; peripheral neuropathy; phloebitis, pain at Inj site, disturbances in renal function and renal toxicity."

Clinical evidence suggests that Calcium is useful for the prevention and treatment of Osteoporosis and associated fractures. Vitamin D is also essential for healthy bones as it aids in Calcium absorption from the GI tract. In addition to this it stimulates bone formation. Clinical studies also show that Calcium and Vitamin D has synergistic effects on bone growth as well as in Osteoporosis and fracture prevention.,"Orally administered Calcium Carbonate may be irritating to the GI tract. It may also cause constipation. Hypercalcemia is rarely produced by administration of Calcium alone, but may occur when large doses are given to patients with chronic renal failure. Also there may be allergic reactions, irregular heartbeats, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite dry mouth and drowsiness, skin rash."
Calcium Lactate Gluconate + Calcium Carbonate + Vitamin C + Vitamin D3,"Calcium Gluconate is the gluconate salt of calcium. An element or mineral necessary for normal nerve, muscle, and cardiac function, calcium as the gluconate salt helps to maintain calcium balance and prevent bone loss when taken orally. This agent may also be chemopreventive for colon and other cancers.Calcium carbonate is a basic inorganic salt that acts by neutralizing hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions. It also inhibits the action of pepsin by increasing the pH and via adsorption. Cytoprotective effects may occur through increases in bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) and prostaglandins. Neutralization of hydrochloric acid results in the formation of calcium chloride, carbon dioxide and water. Approximately 90% of calcium chloride is converted to insoluble calcium salts (e.g. calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate).Calcium is used as a pharmacological agent in humans almost entirely to remedy deficiency. Adequate calcium in the blood is so vital to a wide variety of bodily functions that our internal biochemistry will not tolerate a deficiency even for short periods.Vitamin-C is an essential component of the diet as humans cannot synthesize Vitamin-C.

If there is experience like nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, dry mouth, increased thirst, increased urination while taking, noticed to physicians. Constipation may occur."
Calcium Carbonate [Eggshell Source] + Vitamin D3,"Calcium plays a very important role in the body. It is necessary for normal functioning of bone, nerve cells, muscle, and other vital organs and the regulatory system of the body. If there is not enough calcium in the blood, then the body will take Calcium from bones, thereby weakening bones and triggers different types of bone disorder. Vitamin D3 helps the body to absorb Calcium. Having the right amounts of Calcium and Vitamin D3 is important for building and keeping strong bones and healthy muscles.","Common Side Effects: Generally orally administered Calcium Carbonate may be irritating to the Gl tract and it may also cause constipation but eggshell Calcium is safe for long-term use without causing any Gl discomfort or constipation. Rare Side Effects: Kidney stone, hypercalcemia, alkalosis, loss of appetite."
Calcium Carbonate [Coral source] + Vitamin D3,This is a Calcium and Vitamin D3 preparation where Calcium Carbonate is sourced from coral origin.

Rare side effects are high amount of Calcium in blood, constipation, diarrhoea, loss of appetite."
Calcium Carbonate,Calcium carbonate reacts with gastric acid to produce a salt and water. For calcium carbonate the postulated chemical reaction is: CaCO3+2HCl = CaCl2+H2O+CO2. Two grams of calcium carbonate will readily bring 100 ml of hydrochloric acid to a pH above 6. The increase in gastric pH diminishes the activity of pepsin in the gastric secretion. Up to 30% of the oral calcium load may be absorbed.,"Orally administered Calcium Carbonate may be irritating to the GI tract. It may also cause constipation. Hypercalcaemia is rarely produced by administration of calcium alone, but may occur when large doses are given to patients with chronic renal failure."
Calcium Acetate,"Calcium Acetate when taken with meals, combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble Calcium Phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders. Calcium Acetate is highly soluble at neutral pH, making the Calcium readily available for binding to phosphate in the proximal small intestine. Orally administered Calcium Acetate from pharmaceutical dosage forms has been demonstrated to be systemically absorbed up to approximately 40% under fasting conditions and up to approximately 30% under non fasting conditions. This range represents data from both healthy subjects and renal dialysis patients under various conditions.","Patients may occasionally experience nausea during Calcium Acetate therapy. Hypercalcemia may occur during treatment with Calcium Acetate. Mild hypercalcemia (Ca >10.5 mg/dl) may be asymptomatic or manifest itself as constipation, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. More severe hypercalcemia (Ca >12 mg/dl) is associated with confusion, delirium, stupor and coma. Mild hypercalcemia is easily controlled by reducing the Calcium Acetate dose or temporarily discontinuing therapy. Severe hypercalcemia can be treated by acute hemodialysis and discontinuing Calcium Acetate therapy. Decreasing dialysate calcium concentration could reduce the incidence and severity of Calcium Acetate induced hypercalcemia. The long-term effect of Calcium Acetate on the progression of vascular or soft-tissue calcification has not been determined. Isolated cases of pruritus have been reported which may represent allergic reactions."
Calcium + Vitamin D3 + Vitamin C + Vitamin E + Multimineral,"This medicine is an absolute bone health formula with more than half a dozen key nutrients. Calcium decreases the rate of bone loss from the femoral neck, the spine and the total body. Since calcium is a nutrient, not a drug, the positive effects of supplemental calcium are most pronounced among women with low to moderate calcium intake. Vitamin D3 helps the body to absorb calcium which helps to reduce age-related bone loss and bone fractures related to osteoporosis. Magnesium helps the body to absorb both calcium and vitamin D3. It also helps to synthesize proteins. Low magnesium status has been associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The trace minerals Zinc, Copper and Manganese all play a role in bone development. Zinc is a part of an antioxidant enzyme that helps to prevent cellular destruction, which can cause problems with bone growth and maturation. Copper keeps bones free from thinning. Fifty percent of the total copper content in the body is in the bones and muscles. Manganese, in combination with other trace minerals, helps to prevent bone loss and osteoporosis. Boron works with magnesium and vitamin D3 to enhance calcium absorption and helps to maintain calcium levels in the body. Vitamin C works as an antioxidant. It is also essential for the formation of collagen and aids in iron absorption. Vitamin E serves as an antioxidant, protects biological membranes and stabilizes cellular functions.","Calcium salts may cause mild gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation, flatulence, nausea, abdominal pain & bloating. Hypercalcaemia & in rare cases hypercalciuria have been seen with long term intake of calcium at high doses. Side effects from micronutrients are rare."
Calcitriol + Calcium Citrate,"Calcium salt can be used in the prevention and treatment of calcium deficiency states or negative calcium balance. It is also used as an adjunct in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.Calcitriol promotes calcium absorption in the intestines and retention at the kidneys thus increasing serum calcium levels. It also increases renal tubule phosphate resorption consequently decreasing serum phosphatase levels, PTH levels and bone resorption.",Weakness; headache; somnolence; nausea; vomiting; dry mouth; constipation; muscle pain; bone pain; metallic taste; polyuria; polydipsia; anorexia; irritability; weight loss; nocturia; mild acidosis; reversible azotemia; generalized vascular calcification; nephrocalcinosis; conjunctivitis (calcific); pancreatitis; photophobia; rhinorrhoea; pruritus; hyperthermia; decreased libido; elevated BUN; albuminuria; hypercholesterolaemia; elevated AST and ALT; ectopic calcification; hypertension; cardiac arrhythmias.
Calcitriol,"Calcitriol is one of the most important active metabolites of vitamin D3. It is normally formed in the kidneys from its precursor, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. Calcitriol promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and regulates bone mineralization. The key role of Calcitriol is the regulation of calcium homeostasis, which includes stimulation effects on osteoblastic activity in the skeleton.","Occasional symptoms include anorexia, headache, vomiting and constipation. Chronic effects may include dystrophy, fever, polyuria, dehydration, apathy and urinary tract infection."
Amoxicillin Trihydrate,"Amoxicillin is a broad spectrum penicillin. It is effective against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It acts through the inhibition of biosynthesis of cell wall. Amoxicillin is stable in the presence of gastric acid and is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. After an oral dose, peak plasma concentration of Amoxicillin is reached within 1 to 2 hours. Amoxicillin is widely distributed at varying concentration in body tissues and fluids.","Side effects are mild and transient in nature. This may include diarrhoea, indigestion or occasionally rash. Pseudo-membranous colitis has been reported rarely."
Amoxicillin + Clavulanic Acid,"Pharmacodynamic properties: Co-amoxiclav is an antibacterial combination consisting of the antibiotic Amoxicillin and the (3-lactamase inhibitor Clavulanic Acid. Amoxicillin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many Gram-positive & Gram-negative microorganisms but it is susceptible to degradation by (3-lactamases and therefore the spectrum of activity does not include microorganisms, which produce these enzymes. Clavulanic acid possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of beta-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. Thus Clavulanic acid in this preparation protects Amoxicillin from degradation by (3-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibiotic spectrum to embrace a wide range of microorganisms.Pharmacokinetic properties: The pharmacokinetics of the two components of Co-amoxiclav is closely matched. Peak serum levels of both occur about one hour after oral administration. Absorption of Co-amoxiclav is optimized at the start of a meal. Both clavulanate and Amoxicillin have low levels of serum binding; about 70% remains free in the serum. Doubling the dosage of Co-amoxiclav approximately doubles the serum levels achieved.","Side effects, as with Amoxicillin, are uncommon and mainly of a mild and transitory nature. Diarrhoea, pseudomembranous colitis, indigestion, nausea, vomiting and candidiasis have been reported, if gastrointestinal side effects occur with oral therapy, that may be reduced by taking Co-amoxiclav at the start of meals. Hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported rarely but are usually reversible. Urticarial and erythematous rashes sometimes occur. Rarely erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and exfoliative dermatitis have been reported. In common with other beta-lactam antibiotics, angioedema and anaphylaxis have been reported."

The residence time of carboxymethylcellulose bound to corneal cells is approximately 2 hours as indicated by a short-term binding assay. Binding of carboxymethylcellulose to the matrix proteins stimulated corneal epithelial cell attachment, migration, and re-epithelialization of corneal wounds.This eye drop contains Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium similar to normal tears which acts as an ocular lubricant. It provides a lubricating and hydrating protective shield on the ocular surface.","Burning, Eye Irritation or Pruritus, Visual disturbance, Ocular discharge were reported with this eye drop."
Carboprost Tromethamine,"Carboprost tromethamine administered intramuscularly stimulates in the gravid uterus myometrial contractions similar to labor contractions at the end of a full term pregnancy. Whether or not these contractions result from a direct effect of carboprost on the myometrium has not been determined. Nonetheless, they evacuate the products of conception from the uterus in most cases.Postpartum, the resultant myometrial contractions provide hemostasis at the site of placentation.Carboprost tromethamine also stimulates the smooth muscle of the human gastrointestinal tract. This activity may produce the vomiting or diarrhea or both that is common when carboprost tromethamine is used to terminate pregnancy and for use postpartum. In laboratory animals and also in humans carboprost tromethamine can elevate body temperature. With the clinical doses of carboprost tromethamine used for the termination of pregnancy, and for use postpartum, some patients do experience transient temperature increases.In laboratory animals and in humans large doses of carboprost tromethamine can raise blood pressure, probably by contracting the vascular smooth muscle. With the doses of carboprost tromethamine used for terminating pregnancy, this effect has not been clinically significant. In laboratory animals and also in humans carboprost tromethamine can elevate body temperature. With the clinical doses of carboprost tromethamine used for the termination of pregnancy, some patients do experience temperature increases. In some patients, carboprost tromethamine may cause transient bronchoconstriction.","The most frequent adverse reactions observed are related to its contractile effect on smooth muscle, especially gastrointestinal effects like vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and pyrexia. Endometritis, retained placental fragments, and excessive uterine bleeding occurred as the most common complications after abortion with Carboprost."

Carbocisteine,"Carbocisteine reduces goblet cell hyperplasia and therefore plays a role in the management of disorders characterised by abnormal mucous. Carbocisteine loosens thick sputum effectively by reducing its viscosity and thereby helps to expectorate that mucus more easily from the respiratory tract. The mucolytic action happens in several mechanisms. It breaks the disulphide bonds, which cross-link certain glycoprotein molecules in the mucus, the mucus produced under the influence of Carbocisteine has high sialomucin and low fucomucin content. This combined effect ultimately reduces the viscosity of the sputum and increases its volume.","Gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, diarrhoea, gastrointestinal bleeding, palpitation, dizziness, headache, heartburn and skin rash may occur."
Carbimazole,Carbimazole is metabolised to thiamazole which is responsible for its antithyroid action. It blocks the production of thyroid hormones through inhibition of the organification of iodide and the coupling of iodothyronine residues.,"Nausea, headache, arthralgia, fever, jaundice, malaise, mild gastric distress, skin rashes, pruritus, taste disturbance; bone marrow depression including neutropenia, eosinophilia, leucopenia. Rarely, pancytopenia/aplastic anaemia and isolated thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia."
Carbetocin,"Carbetocin is a drug used to control postpartum hemorrhage, bleeding after giving birth. It is an analogue of oxytocin, and its action is similar to that of oxytocin; it causes contraction of the uterus. Carbetocin binds to oxytocin receptors present on the smooth musculature of the uterus, resulting in rhythmic contractions of the uterus, increased frequency of existing contractions, and increased uterine tone. The oxytocin receptor content of the uterus is very low in the non-pregnant state, and increases during pregnancy, reaching a peak at the time of delivery.","10-40% of patients experienced nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, itching skin, increased body temperature, trembling and weakness. Infrequent adverse events (1-5% of patients) included back pain, dizziness, metallic taste, anaemia, sweating, chest pain, dyspnoea, chills, tachycardia and anxiety."
Carbamazepine,"Carbamazepine depresses activity in the nucleus ventralis of the thalamus, reduces synaptic propagation of excitatory impulses or decreases summation of temporal stimulation leading to neural discharge by limiting influx of Na ions across cell membrane or other unknown mechanisms. It stimulates the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and potentiates its action in promoting reabsorption of water.","The common side effects are dizziness, drowsiness, ataxia, dry mouth, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, leucopenia, proteinuria, bradycardia, heart failure and hypotension. Erythematous skin rash, aplastic anemia may also be observed. The most severe adverse reactions have been observed in the hemopoietic system, the skin and the cardiovascular system.The most frequently observed adverse reactions, particularly during the initial phases of therapy, are dizziness, drowsiness, unsteadiness, nausea, and vomiting. This medicine may cause increased sensitivity to the sun. Exposure to the sun, sunlamps, or tanning booths should be avoided if the increased sensitivity is seen. A sunscreen or protective clothing may be helpful at outside for a prolonged period."
Captopril,"Captopril competitively inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII), thus resulting in reduced ATII levels and aldosterone secretion. It also increases plasma renin activity and bradykinin levels. Reduction of ATII leads to decreased Na and water retention. This promotes vasodilation and BP reduction.","Neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia; proteinuria, elevated blood urea and creatinine, elevated serum potassium and acidosis; hypotension, tachycardia; rashes usually pruritic, may occur; Reversible and usually self limiting taste impairment has been reported. Stomatitis resembling aphthous ulcers has also been reported."
Capsaicin,"Although the precise mechanism of action of Capsaicin is not fully understood, current evidence suggests that Capsaicin exerts an analgesic effect by depleting and preventing reaccumulation of Substance P in peripheral sensory neurons. Substance P is thought to be the principal chemomediator of pain impulses from the periphery to the central nervous system.",Capsaicin may cause transient burning on application. This burning is observed more frequently when the application schedules are more than 3-4 times daily. The burning can be enhanced if too much cream is used and if it is applied just before or after a bath or shower.
Caprylic + Capric Triglyceride,"With physiological lipids to protect & maintain healthy skin.The Derma Membrane Structure (DMS) base, used uniquely in Physiogel products, is made up of natural lipids similar to the skin's (epidermis) physiologic lipids which are natural and essential components of normal healthy skin, hence, revitalizes very dry, irritated and sensitive skin or helps retain skin moisture and prevents skin dryness, thus, regenerates the skin lipid barrier, reduces water loss and provides protection against environmental triggers.","Some possible side effects and reactions include rash, redness and itchiness."
Capecitabine,"Capecitabine is a preparation of Capecitabine, an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumour, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumour tissue.Capecitabine is a prodrug that is selectively tumour-activated to its cytotoxic moiety, fluorouracil, by thymidine phosphorylase, an enzyme found in higher concentrations in many tumours compared to normal tissues or plasma. Fluorouracil is further metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP), within normal and tumour cells. These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, FdUMP and the folate cofactor, N5-10 methylenetetrahydrofolate, bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex. This binding inhibits the formation of thymidylate from 2-deoxyuridylate. Thymidylate is the necessary precursor of thymidine triphosphate, which is essential for the synthesis of DNA, therefore a deficiency of this compound can inhibit cell division. Secondly, nuclear transcriptional enzymes can mistakenly incorporate FUTP in place of uridine triphosphate (UTP) during the synthesis of RNA. This metabolic error can interfere with RNA processing and protein synthesis through the production of fraudulent RNA.","Abdominal pain, Rash, dry or itchy skin, Tiredness, loss of appetite (anorexia), Diarrhea, Vomiting, Nausea, Stomatitis, Hand-and-foot skin-reaction, Fever, Infection, Chest pain, Steven-Johnson syndrome"
Candesartan Cilexetil + Hydrochlorothiazide,"Candesartan Cilexetil-Hydrochlorothiazide combines an angiotensin II receptor blocker, Candesartan Cilexetil and a diuretic, Hydrochlorothiazide. Candesartan Cilexetil is an ester prodrug that is hydrolysed in the body to the active form Candesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues (eg, vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland).Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly by increasing sodium excreation. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increase in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion, urinary potassium loss, and decrease in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of Candesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with Hydrochlorothiazide.","Mild and transient in nature. The overall incidence of adverse events is comparable to placebo. Side effects are headache, upper respiratory tract infection, back pain, influenza-like symptoms."
Candesartan Cilexetil,"Candesartan Cilexetil is an ester prodrug that is hydrolysed in the body to the active form Candesartan during absorption from the gastro-intestinal tract. Candesartan is angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues (eg, vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland).","Side-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high dose diuretics). Hyperkalemia occurs occassionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotension II receptor antagonist. Also vertigo, headache; rarely hepatitis, blood disorders, hyponatraemia, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, rash, urticaria, pruritous."
Canagliflozin Hemihydrate,"Canagliflozin is an inhibitor of subtype-2 sodium-glucose co-transport protein (SGLT2), which is responsible for at least 90% of the glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Blocking this transporter reduces the reabsorption of glucose from renal tubules, leading to more excretion of glucose in urine.","The most common adverse reactions of Canagliflozin are female genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infection and increased urination. Other side effects of Canagliflozin include low blood pressure, increases potassium blood levels (hyperkalemia), low blood glucose and increases Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL-C)."

Menthol acts as a acts as cough suppressant & topical analgesic,"Redness, irritation, rash or pruritis may occur with sensitive skin."
Calcium Polystyrene Sulfonate,"Calcium Polystyrene Sulfonate acts by a cumulative process throughout the gastrointestinal tract, removing potassium ions which are excreted in the feces. Calcium Polystyrene Sulfonate passes through the colon and comes into contact with fluids containing increased amounts of potassium. The result is that potassium is taken up in increasing amounts in exchange for calcium ions. The length of time Calcium Polystyrene Sulfonate remains in the body is a decisive factor in its effectiveness. For this reason oral administration is more effective than rectal administration","Nausea, vomiting, gastric irritation, anorexia, constipation and occasionally diarrhea, fecal impaction, Gastrointestinal stenosis and intestinal obstruction, Gastrointestinal ischemia, ischemic colitis, rectal haemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract ulceration or necrosis, Hypomagnesemia, Hypercalcemia etc. Some cases of acute bronchitis and bronchopneumonia have been reported."

It is also helpful for males in spermatorrhoea, oligospermia, nocturnal emissions, and premature ejaculation and helps to remove leucorrhoea in females.",No significant side effect has been observed in proper dosage.
Alogliptin Benzoate,"Alogliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP-4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved.","Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, headache and upper respiratory tract infection."
Almotriptan,Almotriptan is a selective and potent serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D) agonist. Almotriptan binds to specific serotonin receptors on meningeal arteries inhibiting the release of vasoactive peptides and causing constriction of the arteries. It has a limited effect on arteries supplying blood to the brain and little effect on cardiac and pulmonary vessels.,"Serious cardiac reactions, including myocardial infarction, have occurred following the use of almotriptan malate Tablets. These reactions are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD (Coronary Artery Disease)."
Almitrine Bismesylate + Raubasine,"Almitrine Bismesylate & Raubasine combines raubasine, a vasodilator; and almitrine, a respiratory stimulant. Raubasine has a adrenolytic activity which is predominantly related to a post-synaptic blocking effect. Furthermore, under conditions of cerebral hypoxia, almitrine causes an increase in the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (Pa02); almitrine causes an increase in the Pa02 and an increase in the oxygen saturation in arterial blood (Sa02), without modifying ventilatory parameters.","Weight loss, nausea, sensations of heaviness or burning in the stomach, gastrointestinal disorders, diarrhoea or constipation, insomnia, drowsiness, agitation, anxiety, dizziness, palpitations."
Allylestrenol,"Allylestrenol has been found to have a relatively weak progestational effect on the human endometrium. To obtain a full secretory endometrium in oestrogen-primed castrated women or to postpone menstruation (with an oestrogen added) in normal ovulating women, doses of allylestrenol were required which were higher than those recommended for the treatment/prevention of abortion.In vitro studies have shown that allylestrenol stimulates the synthesis of progesterone in the human placenta. It also brought about a significant (p/. 0,01) increase in the production of some specific placental enzymes (cystine aminopeptidase and heat-stable alkaline phosphatase).Histological and histochemical changes indicating an increased activity have been found in the placenta, particularly in the syncytiotrophoblast of women with a normal and threatened pregnancy, treated with allylestrenol. The stimulatory effect of allylestrenol on placental function was also suggested by the increased level of placental hormones (pregnanediol, oestriol, HCG and HPL) and enzymes (oxytocinase, CAP) in the maternal urine and plasma, which followed the administration of the drug e.g. in the early weeks as well as in the last trimester of pregnancy.A study in full-term pregnant women revealed that allylestrenol in high doses (up to 100 mg daily) did suppress the intensity of spontaneous uterine contractions, but had no effect on the sensitivity of the uterine muscle to oxytocin, and no adverse effect on the progress of normal delivery.Studies in non-pregnant women with and without endocrinological disorders have shown that allylestrenol has no oestrogenic or androgenic properties and no adverse effects on the adrenal function.No abnormal liver function tests or water and salt retention were observed in healthy female volunteers (non pregnant) who were given allylestrenol.","Treatment with Allylestrenol (especially a long term treatment) is known to cause some gastrointestinal complaints such as vomiting, nausea, and sometimes epigastric discomfort."

Cefuroxime Axetil + Clavulanic Acid,Cefuroxime is a bactericidal second generation cephalosporin antibiotic which is active against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative susceptible organisms including many beta-lactamase producing strains. Cefuroxime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with the transpeptidation process.Clavulanic acid is a naturally derived beta lactamase inhibitor produced by Streptomyces clavuligerus. It has similar structure to beta lactam antibiotics which binds irreversibly to beta-lactamase enzymes and inactivates them. Clavulanic acid gives protection of Cefuroxime from degradation by beta lactamase enzymes and provides a solution for the treatment of bacterial infections caused by beta lactam resistant bacteria.,"Generally Cefuroxime-Clavulanic Acid is well tolerated. However, a few side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort or pain may occur. As with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged administration of Cefuroxime and Clavulanic acid combination may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms. Rarely (<0.2%) renal dysfunction, anaphylaxis, angioedema, pruritis, rash and serum sickness like urticaria may appear."
Cefuroxime Axetil,"Cefuroxime is a well-characterized and effective antibacterial agent, which has broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against a wide range of common pathogens, including β-lactamase producing strains. Cefuroxime has good stability to bacterial β-lactamase and consequently, is active against many ampicillin-resistant and amoxycillin-resistant strains.","Adverse effects to Cefuroxime have occurred infrequently and have been generally mild and transient in nature. Effects reported include rashes and gastrointestinal disturbances. As with other antibiotics, prolonged use may result in the overgrowth of non susceptible organisms e.g. Candida."
Ceftriaxone Sodium,"Ceftriaxone is a 3rd generation broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic. It has potent bactericidal activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Like other cephalosporins and penicillins, Ceftriaxone kills bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).","Ceftriaxone is generally well tolerated. A few side effects such as gastro-intestinal effects including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, stomatitis and glossitis; cutaneous reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema and erythema multiforme; hematologic reactions including eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, anemia and neutropenia; hepatic reactions including elevations of SGOT or SGPT, bilirubinemia; CNS reactions including nervousness, confusion, sleep disturbances, headache, hyperactivity, convulsion, hypertonia and dizziness were reported. Local phlebitis occurs rarely following intravenous administration but can be minimized by slow injections over 2-4 minutes."
Ceftibuten Dihydrate,"Ceftibuten is the dihydrate salt of Ceftibuten, is a semi-synthetic Cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. Ceftibuten exerts its bactericidal action by binding to essential target proteins of the bacterial cell wall. This binding leads to inhibition of cell-wall synthesis.","Nausea, headache, diarrhea, dyspepsia, dizziness, abdominal pain, vomiting."
Ceftazidime Pentahydrate,"Ceftazidime is a semisynthetic, broad-spectrum, beta-lactam antibiotic for parenteral administration. Ceftazidime is bactericidal in action exerting its effect by inhibition of enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis. A wide range of gram-negative organisms is susceptible to ceftazidime in vitro, including strains resistant to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides. In addition, ceftazidime has been shown to be active against gram-positive organisms. It is highly stable to most clinically important beta-lactamases, plasmid or chromosomal, which are produced by both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms and, consequently, is active against many strains resistant to ampicillin and other cephalosporins.","The most common side-effects are local reactions following IV injection and allergic and gastrointestinal reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions are pruritus, rash, and fever. Angioedema and anaphylaxis have been reported very rarely. Gastrointestinal symptoms are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Central nervous system reactions included headache, dizziness, and paresthesia."
Ceftazidime + Avibactam,"Ceftazidime inhibits bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis following binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs), which leads to bacterial cell lysis and death. Avibactam is a non β-lactam, β-lactamase inhibitor that acts by forming a covalent adduct with the enzyme that is stable to hydrolysis. It inhibits both Ambler class A and class C β-lactamases and some class D enzymes, including extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), KPC and OXA-48 carbapenemases, and AmpC enzymes. Avibactam does not inhibit class B enzymes (metallo-β-lactamases) and is not able to inhibit many class D enzymes.","severe allergic reactions: signs include sudden swelling of your lips, face, throat or tongue, a severe rash or other severe skin reactions, difficulty swallowing or breathing. This reaction may be life-threatening. diarrhoea that keeps getting worse or does not go away, or stools that contains blood or mucus-this may happen during or after treatment is stopped with this combination. If this happens do not take medicines that stop or slow bowel movement."

It is cooling, stimulant, tonic and demulcent. It is useful in haemorrhoid.",There is no significant side effect.
Acarbose,"In contrast to sulfonylureas, Acarbose does not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of acarbose results from a competitive, reversible inhibition of pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucoside hydrolase enzymes. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, while the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in a delayed glucose absorption and a lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of Acarbose to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin when used in combination. In addition, Acarbose diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas. Acarbose has no inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance.","Diarrhea, gas, upset stomach, constipation, or stomach pain may occur in the first few weeks of treatment as your body adjusts to this medication but usually improve with time. Follow your prescribed diet to help lessen these side effects. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly."
Acalabrutinib,"Acalabrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of BTK. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity. BTK is a signaling molecule of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. In nonclinical studies, acalabrutinib inhibited BTK-mediated activation of downstream signaling proteins CD86 and CD69 and inhibited malignant B-cell proliferation and tumor growth in mouse xenograft models.","Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥30%) were: anemia, neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, thrombocytopenia, headache, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain."
Abiraterone Acetate,"Abiraterone is an orally active inhibitor of the steroidal enzyme CYP17A1 (17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17,20 lyase). It inhibits CYP17A1 in a selective and irreversible manner via covalent binding mechanism. CYP17A1 is an enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of androgen and is highly expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissue. More specifically, abiraterone inhibits the conversion of 17-hydroxyprognenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) by the enzyme CYP17A1 to decrease serum levels of testosterone and other androgens.","The most common adverse reactions are fatigue, arthralgia, hypertension, nausea, edema, hypokalemia, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory infection, cough, and headache."
Abemaciclib,"Abemaciclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. In vitro, continuous exposure to abemaciclib inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis. In breast cancer xenograft models, abemaciclib dosed daily without interruption as a single agent or in combination with antiestrogens resulted in reduction of tumor size.","Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) were diarrhea, neutropenia, nausea, abdominal pain, infections, fatigue, anemia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, headache, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia."
Abacavir + Lamivudine + Zidovudine,"Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue and an antiviral agent. Intracellularly, abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite carbovir triphosphate, an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate (dGTP). Carbovir triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA. Viral DNA growth is terminated because the incorporated nucleotide lacks a 3'-OH group, which is needed to form the 5′ to 3′ phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation.Lamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue and is phosphorylated intracellularly to its active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate (L-TP). This nucleoside analogue is incorporated into viral DNA by HIV reverse transcriptase and HBV polymerase, resulting in DNA chain termination.Zidovudine, a structural analog of thymidine, is a prodrug that must be phosphorylated to its active 5′-triphosphate metabolite, zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP). It inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue. It competes with the natural substrate dGTP and incorporates itself into viral DNA. It is also a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerase α and γ.","The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence at least 10%) in clinical trials were nausea, headache, malaise and fatigue, and nausea and vomiting."
Ciclopirox Olamine (Nail Lacquer),"Ciclopirox is a synthetic antifungal agent. Ciclopirox Nail Lacquer is a clear, colorless to slightly yellowish solution. It is intended for topical use on fingernails and toenails and immediately adjacent skin In contrast to the azoles and other antimycotic drugs, the mechanism of action of Ciclopirox is poorly understood. However, loss of function of certain catalase and peroxidase enzymes of fungi has been Implicated as the mechanism of action, as well as various other components of cellular metabolism.",Commonly redness/burning of treated skin or changes in shape/color of the nail may occur. Very serious allergic reaction to Ciclopirox is rare.
Ciclopirox Olamine (Cream),"Ciclopirox Olamine is a synthetic broad spectrum antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of pathogenic dermatophytes, yeasts, and Malassezia furfur. Ciclopirox Olamine exhibits fungicidal activity in vitro against isolates of Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, and Candida albicans. The mode of action of Ciclopirox Olamine was studied mainly in Candida albicans. It is presumed that Ciclopirox Olamine mediated growth inhibition or death of fungal cells is primarily caused by in vitro cellular depletion of some essential substrates and/or ions and that such effects are brought about through blockage of their uptake from the medium.In addition to its broad spectrum of antifungal action, Ciclopirox also exerts antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Theanti-inflammatory effects of Ciclopirox have been demonstratedin human polymorphonuclear cells, where Ciclopirox has inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin and leukotriene. Ciclopirox can also exhibit its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the formation of 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase.",Ciclopirox Olamine cream is well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse reactions reported in clinical trials.
Ciclesonide (Nasal Spray),Ciclesonide nasal spray is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. It is an aqueous suspension of ciclesonide for topical administration to the nasal mucosa by means of a metering and atomizing spray pump. It is necessary to prime the pump before first use or after a period of non-use (4 days or more).,"Ciclesonide nasal spray is absorbed less into rest of the body; therefore fewer side effects are seen. However, few side-effects like headache, dizziness, nosebleed, stuffy nose, earache may occur."
Ciclesonide (Inhalation Aerosol),"Ciclesonide, which is a new once daily inhaled corticosteroid, is an ester prodrug that requires hydrolyzation by endogenous esterases in the lung to form its active metabolite (B-9207-021). The activated ciclesonide has an approximately 100-fold greater affinity for glucocorticoid receptors compared with the parent compound and produces high local anti-inflammatory activity.","Common (1-10%): Paradoxical bronchospasm; uncommon (0.1-1%): Bad taste, application site reactions, application site dryness, hoarseness, cough after inhalation, rash and eczema.Systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for prolonged periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects include adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Patients with severe hepatic impairment should be monitored for potential systemic effects."
Choriogonadotropin Alpha,"The physicochemical, immunological, and biological activities of recombinant hCG are comparable to those of placental and human pregnancy urine-derived hCG. Choriogonadotropin alfa stimulates late follicular maturation and resumption of oocyte meiosis, and initiates rupture of the pre-ovulatory ovarian follicle. Choriogonadotropin alfa, the active component of Choriogonadotropin Alpha PreFilled Syringe, is an analogue of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and binds to the LH/hCG receptor of the granulosa and theca cells of the ovary to effect these changes in the absence of an endogenous LH surge. In pregnancy, hCG, secreted by the placenta, maintains the viability of the corpus luteum to provide the continued secretion of estrogen and progesterone necessary to support the first trimester of pregnancy. Choriogonadotropin Alpha PreFilled Syringe is administered when monitoring of the patient indicates that sufficient follicular development has occurred in response to FSH treatment for ovulation induction.","Injection site inflammation and reaction, flatulence, diarrhea, hiccup, ectopic pregnancy, breast pain, intermenstrual bleeding, vaginal hemorrhage, cervical lesion, leukorrhea, ovarian hyperstimulation, uterine disorders, vaginitis, vaginal discomfort, body pain, back pain, fever, dizziness, headache, hot flashes, malaise, paraesthesias, rash, emotional lability, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, dysuria, urinary tract infection, urinary incontinence, albuminuria, cardiac arrhythmia, genital moniliasis, genital herpes, leukocytosis, heart murmurand cervical carcinoma."
Chlorthalidone,"Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-type Diuretic- Antihypertensive, used for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in association with other antihypertensive agents. Chlortalidone is also indicated for adjunctive therapy of edema associated with: renal disease; congestive heart failure of mild to moderate degree (functional class II, Ill), when glomerular filtration rate is greater than 30 ml/min; ascites due to cirrhosis of the liver in stable patients; estrogen therapy; corticosteroid therapy.Chlorthalidone inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the distal renal tubule thus promoting water loss. The higher urine volume increases potassium loss. Little information is available on the absorption of the drug. Its long elimination half-life and clinical experience place it as a long-acting thiazide derivative. The longer-acting agents appear to cause increased potassium loss.Although a mild diuretic, its combination with loop diuretics is particularly potent because the latter presents much more sodium chloride to the distal tubule.The blood pressure lowering effects are initially due to volume reduction but the persisting effect includes other undetermined mechanisms that reduce peripheral resistance. A high salt intake reverses its antihypertensive effect.The major portion of an absorbed dose of Chlorthalidone is excreted by the kidneys with an elimination half life averaging 50 hours. Metabolism and hepatic excretion into the bile constitute a minor way of elimination. Within 120 hours, about 70% of the dose is excreted in the urine and in the feces, mainly in an unchanged form.","Electrolytes and Metabolic Disorders: Frequent: mainly at higher doses, hypokalemia, hyperuricemia and rise in blood lipids. Occasional: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia and hyperglycemia. Rare: hypercalcemia, glycosuria, worsening of diabetic metabolic state and gout.Isolated cases: hypochloremic alkalosis.Dermatology: Occasional: urticaria and other forms of skin rash. Rare: photosensitization.Liver: Rare: Intrahepatic cholestasis or jaundice.Cardiovascular: Occasional: postural hypotension, which may be aggravated by alcohol, anesthetics or sedatives. Rare: cardiac arrhythmias.CNS: Occasional: dizziness, slow mentation and decreased reaction time."
Chlorpromazine Hydrochloride,"Chlorpromazine is a neuroleptic that acts by blocking the postsynaptic dopamine receptor in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and inhibits the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones.

Haematological: Leucopenia, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, hemolytic anaemia, aplastic anaemia, thrombocytopenic purpura and pancytopenia have been reported."
Chlorpheniramine Maleate,Chlorpheniramine Maleate is an alkylamine antihistamine. It is one of the most potent histamine H1-receptor blocking agents which is used as a potent antihistamine. This generally causes less sedation than promethazine. Chlorpheniramine Maleate exerts its effects by blocking H1-receptor competitively.,"Chlorpheniramine is well-tolerated, but sometimes drowsiness, dizziness, muscular weakness, and gastrointestinal upset may occur."
Chloroxylenol + Triclosan,"It is bactericidal against most gram-positive bacteria. Chloroxylenol is used in hospitals and households for disinfection and sanitation. It is also commonly used in antibacterial soaps, wound-cleansing applications and household antiseptics such as Dettol liquid (to which it contributes its distinctive odor), cream and ointments. Triclosan, a chlorinated bisphenol antiseptic, is active against fungi, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.","Skin sensitivity; irritation of conjunctiva, mucosal irritation; reversible brown staining of the teeth; tongue discoloration and burning sensation; transient taste disturbance; parotid gland swelling."

It is also commonly used in antibacterial soaps, wound-cleansing applications and household antiseptics such as liquid (to which it contributes its distinctive odor), cream and ointments.","Skin sensitivity; irritation of conjunctiva, mucosal irritation; reversible brown staining of the teeth; tongue discoloration and burning sensation; transient taste disturbance; parotid gland swelling."
Chloroquine Phosphate,"Chloroquine is used for malarial prophylaxis (as a suppressive) and in managing acute attacks of malaria. It is highly active against erythrocytic forms of P. vivax, P. malariae and P. falciparum. It influences Hb digestion by increasing intravesicular pH in malaria parasite cells and interferes with the nucleoprotein synthesis of the patient. It is also effective in extra intestinal amoebiasis. In RA chloroquine and more effectively hydroxychloroquine have a disease-modifying effect.","Choroquine is well tolerated at the standard dosage regimens, side effects such as headache and gastrointestinal disturbances which may occur are not of a serious nature. Where prolonged high dose is required side effects can be of greater severity and patients may develop skin eruptions, occasional depigmentation or loss of hair, difficulty in accommodation, blurring of vision. Corneal opacities disappear completely when the drug is stopped. Rarely thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia have been reported.The most serious toxic hazard of prolonged therapy with doses is the occasional development of irreversible retinal damage. For this reason considerable caution is needed in the use of choroquine for long-term high dosage therapy and such use should only be considered when no other drug is available. Defects in visual accommodation may occur on first taking choloquine and patients should be warned regarding driving or operating machinery."
Chlorhexidine hydrochloride + Nystatin,Nystatin is a fungistatic and fungicidal antibiotic primarily effective against Candida albicans. Chlorhexidine has activity against a wide range of bacteria. Nystatin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is not absorbed through the skin or mucous membranes when applied topically,"Common side effects: Allergic skin reactions such as dermatitis, pruritus, erythema, eczema, rash and skin irritation. Rare side effects: Severe allergic reactions, leading to a drop in blood pressure and even to unconsciousness."
Chlorhexidine Hydrochloride + Cetrimide,"Cetrimide is a quaternary ammonium antiseptic; it has bactericidal activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Chlorhexidine is an antimicrobial agent; it is active against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive vegetative bacteria, yeasts, dermatophyte fungi and lipophilic viruses.",Repeated application may lead to skin irritation.
Chlorhexidine Gluconate + Isopropyl alcohol,"Chlorhexidine is a very potent cationic chemoprophylactic agent that has a broad-spectrum of activity against gm+ve and gm-ve bacteria. It is both bacteriostatic and bactericidal depending on its concentration. The bactericidal effect, which is achieved at high concentrations, is due to the binding of the cationic to negatively charged bacterial cell walls and extramicrobial complexes. Bacteriostatic effect is achieved at low concentrations which causes an alteration of bacterial cell osmotic equilibrium and leakage of potassium and phosphorus.",Irritative skin reactions can occasionally occur. Generalised allergic reactions have also been reported but are extremely rare
Chlorhexidine Gluconate + Cetrimide,"Chlorhexidine: Chlorhexidine is an antiseptic and disinfectant which is effective against a wide range of vegetative Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, some viruses and some fungi. It is ineffective against bacterial spores at room temperature, and acid-fast bacteria are inhibited but not killed. It is more active against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria and some species of Pseudomonas and Proteus are relatively less susceptible. Chlorhexidine is most active at a neutral or slightly acid pH and its activity may be reduced by blood and other organic matter.Cetrimide: Cetrimide is a quaternary ammonium disinfectant with properties typical of cationic surfactants. Solutions of these surfactants have emulsifying and detergent properties and bactericidal activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms but higher concentrations are necessary to kill the latter. The combined detergent and antibacterial properties of cetrimide make it useful in cleansing dirty or infected wounds. It is however, relatively ineffective against bacterial spores, acid-fast bacteria, viruses and fungi.","Irritative skin reactions and hypersensitivity reactions to chlorhexidine have been reported. In the event that these reactions occur, discontinue use. Cetrimide may have a prolonging effect on the wound healing process."
Chlorhexidine Gluconate [1%],"Chlorhexidine is a very potent cationic chemoprophylactic agent that has a broad-spectrum of activity against gm+ve and gm-ve bacteria. It is both bacteriostatic and bactericidal depending on its concentration. The bactericidal effect, which is achieved at high concentrations, is due to the binding of the cationic to negatively charged bacterial cell walls and extramicrobial complexes. Bacteriostatic effect is achieved at low concentrations which causes an alteration of bacterial cell osmotic equilibrium and leakage of potassium and phosphorus.","Allergic reactions like sudden wheeziness, difficulty in breathing, swelling of the eyelids, face or lips, rash or itching (specially affecting the whole body) may occur."
Chlorhexidine Gluconate [0.2%],"Chlorhexidine is a very potent cationic chemoprophylactic agent that has a broad-spectrum of activity against gm+ve and gm-ve bacteria. It is both bacteriostatic and bactericidal depending on its concentration.

Bacteriostatic effect is achieved at low concentrations which causes an alteration of bacterial cell osmotic equilibrium and leakage of potassium and phosphorus.",Skin sensitivity; mucosal irritation; reversible brown staining of the teeth; tongue discoloration and burning sensation; transient taste disturbance; parotid gland swelling.
Clascoterone,"Acne is a multifactorial skin condition characterized by excess sebum production, epithelial hyperkeratinization, proliferation of the skin commensal bacteria, and inflammation. Circulating and locally synthesized natural ligands, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), serve as causative factors in both males and females. Upon binding of DHT, the DHT-androgen receptor complex dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of genes involved in acne pathogenesis, including proliferation and differentiation of sebocytes, excess sebum production, and inflammatory cytokine production. Clascoterone is a potent antagonist at ARs and competes for androgens in binding to the receptor, thereby inhibiting downstream signalling of ARs that promote acne.Androgenetic alopecia is also an androgen-dependent and highly genetic condition. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binds to ARs expressed on dermal papilla cells (DPC) in the scalp to induce AR-mediated transcription of genes that contribute to androgenic alopecia. By blocking the interaction between DHT and aARs, clascoterone inhibits AR-regulated transcription and DHT-induced IL-6 synthesis.","Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.In two identical multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials, 1421 subjects 12 years and older with facial acne vulgaris applied Clascoterone cream or vehicle twice daily for 12 weeks. Overall, 62% of the subjects were female, and 38% were male, 91% of the patients were Caucasian, and the mean age was 19.7 years.Local skin reactions (edema, erythema/redness, pruritus, scaling/dryness, skin atrophy, stinging/burning, striae rubrea, telangiectasia) were observed during the 12-week treatment and occurred in a similar percentage of subjects treated with vehicle."
Clarithromycin,"Clarithromycin acts by inhibiting microsomal protein synthesis in susceptible organisms mainly by binding to the donor site on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and preventing translocation to that site. Clarithromycin is active against most Gram-positive bacteria and Chlamydia, some Gram-negative bacteria and Mycoplasmas. Clarithromycin's activity is the same as, or greater than, that of Erythromycin in vitro against most Gram-positive bacteria. Clarithromycin is more acid-stable than Erythromycin and therefore, is better tolerated. Clarithromycin has twice the activity of Erythromycin against H. influenzae. Most species of Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to Clarithromycin because of failure to penetrate the target.","Clarithromycin is generally well tolerated. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Stomatitis and glossitis have also been reported. Other side effects include headache, allergic reactions ranging from urticaria and mild skin reactions to anaphylaxis. Taste perversion may occur. There have been reports of transient central nervous system side effects including anxiety, dizziness, insomnia and hallucination."

Citric Acid is a demulcent which relieves irritation of the mucous membrane in the throat by forming a protective film. Citric Acid is absorbed after oral administration. It is found naturally in the body and is widely distributed.,"There are no known side effects from using this medicine when used as directed. If taken excessively above the stated dose, glycerol present in the medicine may cause headache, stomach upset and diarrhea."
Citicoline Sodium,"Citicoline is a naturally occurring substance that is an essential intermediate in the synthesis of structural phospholipids of cell membrane. Oral dose of Citicoline is metabolized to choline & cytidine. These then enter into the systemic circulation, cross the blood-brain barrier and recombine to form Citicoline within the central nervous system. Citicoline activates the biosynthesis of structural phospholipids in the neuronal membrane, promotes rapid repair of injured cell surface & mitochondrial membrane & increases the level of various neurotransmitters like acetylcholine & dopamine. Citicoline has neuroprotective effects in situations of hypoxia & ischemia, as well as improved learning & memory performance in animal models for the aging brain. Citicoline inhibits the activation of Phospholipase A2 to prevent apoptotic & necrotic cell death.",Occasionally Citicoline may exert stimulating action of the parasympathetic system as well as a fleeting & discrete hypotensive effect.
Citalopram Hydrobromide,"Citalopram is bicyclic phthalane derivative and a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, with little or no effect on noradrenaline, dopamine and GABA re-uptake. The inhibitory activity explains the antidepressant property of citalopram. It has no or very low affinity for 5-HT1AA, 5-HT2A, D1 and D2 receptors, α1, α2, β-adrenergic, histamine H1, muscarinic, cholinergic, benzodiazepine and opioid receptors.","SSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. However, side-effects may be seen, includes gastro-intestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss, palpitations, tachycardia, postural hypotension, cough, confusion, impaired concentration, amnesia, urinary retention, sweating, movement disorders, urticaria, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia and photosensitivity."
Cisplatin,Cisplatin modifies cell cycle by interfering with DNA structure and function. Effects are most prominent during the S phase but cells are killed at all stages. Cisplatin synergises with other anticancer drugs e.g. fluorouracil. It has a narrow therapeutic margin and is highly toxic.,"Severe nausea and vomiting. Serious toxic effects on the kidneys, bone marrows and ears. Hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperuricaemia. Peripheral neuropathies, papilloedema, optic neuritis, seizures. Ototoxicity (children) manifested as tinnitus, loss of hearing, deafness or vestibular toxicity."
Ciprofloxacin + Hydrocortisone Acetate,"Ciprofloxacin promotes breakage of double-stranded DNA in susceptible organisms and inhibits DNA gyrase, which is essential in reproduction of bacterial DNA.Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Its anti-inflammatory action is due to the suppression of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It may also be used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical insufficiency.","The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions seen with Ciprofloxacin are transient ocular burning or discomfort. Other reported reactions include stinging, redness, itching, periocular/facial edema, foreign body sensation, photophobia, blurred vision, tearing, dryness and eye pain. Rare reports of dizziness have been received.The reactions due to the steroid component are elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage, posterior sub-capsular cataract formation and delayed wound healing."
Ciprofloxacin + Dexamethasone,"Dexamethasone is glucocorticoid. It has an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic action. It is used topically in the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the anterior segment of the eye. It reduces prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme phospholipase A2. Also, Dexamethasone inhibits the chemotactic infiltration of neutrophils into the site of inflammation.Ciprofloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, possessing the greatest antibacterial activity of all quinolones. The bactericidal action of Ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase which is needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA.","Frequently reported adverse reactions are transient ocular burning or discomfort. Other reported reactions include stinging, redness, itching, photophobia, conjunctivitis/ keratitis, Periocular/ facial edema, foreign body sensation, blurred vision, tearing, dryness, and eye pain. Elevation of IOP with development of glaucoma, and delayed wound healing may rarely occur."
Ciprofloxacin (Ophthalmic),"Ciprofloxacin is a synthetic broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent for intravenous administration. The bactericidal action of Ciprofloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination.","Local burning or discomfort, itching, foreign body sensation, crystalline precipitates, lid margin crusting, conjunctival hyperemia and a bad taste following administration. Photophobia and nausea may be reported."
Ciprofloxacin,Ciprofloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone. It has bactericidal activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. It inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis by binding with the bacterial enzyme-DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV which are responsible for DNA supercoiling.,"Side effects include- nausea and other gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, dizziness, joint pain and skin rashes."
Ciprofibrate,Ciprofbrate reduces both LDL & VLDL and hence the levels of triglyceride and cholesterol associated with these lipoprotein fractions. It also increases levels of HDL cholesterol. Ciprofbrate is effective in the treatment of hyperlipidemia associated with high plasma concentrations of LDL and VLDL. There is evidence that treatment with fibrates may reduce coronary heart disease events.,"Headache, Dizziness, Somnolence, Vertigo, Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhoea, Dyspepsia, Abdominal pain, Rash, Alopecia, Myalgia, Fatigue."
Cinnarizine + Dimenhydrinate,This contains two active ingredients Cinnarizine and Dimenhydrinate. The two substances belong to different groups of medicines. Cinnarizine is part of a group called calcium antagonists. Dimenhydrinate belongs to a group called antihistamines. Both substances work by reducing symptoms of vertigo (a feeling of dizziness or spinning) and nausea (feeling sick). The combination product is more effective than the individual compounds.,"Drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, and stomach pain may occur. Rare side effects are impaired vision, allergic reactions, light sensitivity, and difficulty in urinating. Other possible reactions which may occur: weight gain, constipation, tightness of the chest, jaundice, worsening of angle-closure glaucoma, uncontrollable movements, unusual excitement and restlessness, severe skin reactions."
Cinnarizine,"Cinnarizine acts as an antihistamine, labyrinthine sedative and a peripheral antivasoconstrictor. Cinnarizine is a selective calcium antagonist, inhibiting the influx of Ca2+ intracellularly. It prevents the Ca2+ dependent contraction of arterial smooth muscle by inhibiting Ca2+ influx through smooth muscle calcium channels and thereby, improves vestibular symptoms and prevents peripheral arterial disease",Side effects such as somnolence and gastrointestinal disturbances are extremely rare. They are transient and may be readily prevented by achieving the optimal dosage gradually. Allergic skin reactions and fatigue have been reported on rare occasions. An aggravation or appearance of extrapyramidal symptoms has been reported extremely rarely in elderly people during prolonged therapy. The treatment should be reduced or stopped in such cases.
Cinchocaine Hydrochloride,Cinchocaine prevents or diminishes nerve impulse conduction near to the site of admin. It also has membrane-stabilising effect owing to decrease of permeability of the nerve cell to sodium ions.,Restlessness; excitement; nervousness; paraesthesias; dizziness; tinnitus; blurred vision; nausea; vomiting; muscle twitching; tremors; convulsions; hypotension; bradycardia; arrhythmias; cardiac arrest.
Cinchocaine + Hydrocortisone + Neomycin + Esculin,Cinchocaine is a local anesthetic which relieves severe pain and relaxes sphincteric spasm. Hydrocortisone acts as an anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic agent and thereby eliminates itching and inflammation. Neomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic which eradicates most infections which may already be present or arise in lesions of the anorectal area. Esculin improves skin vasculature and is effective in management of cellulitis.,Side effects which have been reported for individual constituents may occur and appropriate precautions should be taken when using this preparation.
Cinchocaine + Hydrocortisone + Framycetin + Esculin,"The local anaesthetic Cinchocaine Hydrochloride prevents or relieves the severe pain sometimes encountered in strangulated haemorrhoids, fissures and perianal haematomata, whilst the corticosteroid (Hydrocortisone) acts as a decongestant, anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic agent and by so doing eliminates itching, inflammation and mucous discharge. The broad spectrum antibiotic, Framycetin Sulphate, will eradicate most infections which may already be present or arise in lesions of the anorectal area and Esculin has a skin protective action.","Long-term continuous treatment with topical corticosteroids should be avoided as far as possible as this may cause atrophic changes in the skin leading to thinning, loss of elasticity, dilatation of superficial blood vessels, telangiectasia and ecchymoses. These changes are particularly likely to occur when occlusive dressings are used. Systemic absorption of topically applied corticosteroids may occur, particularly under the following conditions: when large quantities are used or when application is made to wide areas of the body, or to damaged skin; when potent topical corticosteroids are used, and when the occlusive dressing technique is applied. Depression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with consequent suppression of the adrenal gland may occur. These effects are most likely to be severe in children. Growth may be retarded and a Cushingoid state may be produced. Benign intracranial hypertension has been rarely reported."
Cinacalcet,Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent. It lowers parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor of the parathyroid gland to activation by extracellular calcium. PTH reduction leads to concomitant decrease in serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations.,"The common side effects of Cinacalcet are nausea, vomiting, anorexia; dizziness, paraesthesia, asthenia; reduced testosterone concentrations; myalgia; rash; less commonly dyspepsia, diarrhoea, and seizures; hypotension and heart failure also reported."
Cilostazol,"Cilostazol is a preparation of Cilostazol which is a quinolinone derivative. The mechanism of action is to specifically inhibit cellular phosphodiesterase III (PDE III) and suppress cAMP degradation with a resultant increase in cAMP in platelets and blood vessels, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation.","The most common side effects are headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, leg cramps, rash etc. The less frequent side effects are anorexia and edema."
Cilnidipine,"Cilnidipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker. Cilnidipine binds to the dihydropy-ridine binding sites of the L-type voltage dependent calcium channel and inhibits Ca2+ influx across the cell membranes of vascular smooth muscle cells via this channel, consequently vascular smooth muscle is relaxed, causing vasodilation. Cilnidipine inhibits Ca2+ influx via N-type voltage dependent calcium channels in the sympathetic nerve cell membrane. The inhibition of Ca2+ influx via N-type voltage dependent calcium channel was observed over a similar range of drug concentrations to those inhibiting L-type voltage dependent Ca2+ channels. Consequently, release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals would be inhibited. Cilnidipine is considered to suppress the reflex increase in heart rate after blood pressure reduction.",The most common side effects of Cilnidipine are: Dizziness; flushing; headache; hypotension; peripheral oedema; palpitations; GI disturbances; increased micturition frequency; lethargy; eye pain; depression.
Ciclopirox Olamine (Shampoo),"Ciclopirox Olamine is a synthetic broad spectrum antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of pathogenic dermatophytes, yeasts, and Malassezia furfur. Ciclopirox Olamine exhibits fungicidal activity in-vitro against isolates of Trichophyton rubrum,   Trichophyton    mentagrophytes,   Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, and Candida albicans. The mode of action of Ciclopirox Olamine was studied mainly in Candida albicans. It is presumed that Ciclopirox Olamine mediated growth inhibition or death of fungal cells is primarily caused by in-vitro cellular depletion of some essential substrates and/or ions and that such effects are brought about through blockage of their uptake from the medium. In addition to its broad spectrum of antifungal action, Ciclopirox also exerts antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The anti-inflammatory effects of Ciclopirox have been demonstrated in human polymorphonuclear cells, where Ciclopirox has inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin and leukotriene. Ciclopirox can also exhibit its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the formation of 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase.",Ciclopirox Olamine Shampoo is well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse reactions reported in clinical trials.
Clostridium Botulinum Toxin Type A Neurotoxin,"Neurotoxin from Clostridium botulinum; prevents ACh release from presynaptic membrane, causing temporary calming of muscle contractions by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses.Botulinum Toxin Type A blocks the signals between the nerve & its muscle. When this happens a lot of the limb tightness disappears which in tum, allows the muscle a better chance to grow normally. Just as important, Botulinum Toxin Type A therapy can put off surgery a little longer. By encouraging normal movement, child's body is given the chance to grow.","Serious adverse reactions were not observed in clinical trials. The most common adverse reaction was skin rash. Other reactions such as chills, muscle cramps, back pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and wheezing were the most frequent adverse reactions observed during the clinical trials of similarly-prepared human IGIV products."
Clopidogrel Bisulphate,"Clopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.","Clopidogrel is generally well tolerated drug. 

Common side effects: Bleeding, Diarrhoea, gastrointestinal discomfort, haemorrhage, Skin reactions.
Rare side effects: Acquired haemophilia, anaemia, angioedema, arthralgia, arthritis, bone marrow disorders."
Clopidogrel + Aspirin,"Clopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7. Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.",This combination is generally well tolerated.
Clonidine Hydrochloride,"Clonidine stimulates α2-adrenoceptors in the brain stem which results in reduced sympathetic outflow from the CNS, and a decrease in peripheral resistance, heart rate, BP and renal vascular resistance.","Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, depression, anxiety, nausea, fatigue, anorexia, parotid pain, paraesthesia, delusional perception, sleep disturbances, vivid dreams, impotence and loss of libido, urinary retention or incontinence, orthostatic hypotension, itching or burning sensations in the eye, accommodation disorder, decreased lacrimation, fluid retention, pruritus and rashes (transdermal), bradycardia, other ECG disturbances, heart failure, hallucinations, cramp, Raynaud's syndrome, gynaecomastia, transient abnormalities in LFTs."
Clonazepam,"Clonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.","The most frequently occurring side effects of Clonazepam are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur."
Clomipramine Hydrochloride,"Clomipramine hydrochloride belongs to a group of medicines called ""tricyclic antidepressants"". This is thought to work either by increasing the amount of chemical ""messengers"" in the brain or by making their effects last longer. Clomipramine is a potent inhibitor of serotonin re-uptake in the brain. Significant antagonism at cholinergic and α1-receptors. Weak antagonism at dopamine receptors. It has also antidepressant, sedative and anticholinergic effects.","Very common side effects are increase in appetite and weight gain, headaches, dizziness, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, increased sweating, shaking hands, tremor, difficulty in passing urine, problems with their eyes, feeling tired or sleepy, sexual disturbances, restlessness."
Clomiphene Citrate,"Clomiphene has mainly antiestrogenic effects and some estrogenic effects. The mechanism in stimulating ovulation is unknown but is believed to be related to its antiestrogenic properties. By clomiphene competing with estrogen for binding sites at the hypothalamic level, the gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), secretion is increased, which results in ovarian follicle maturation, followed by the preovulatory LH surge, ovulation, and the subsequent development of the corpus luteum. Usefulness in male infertility is also likely related to the increases in FSH and LH secretion.","Clomiphene Citrate is well tolerated. However a few side effects like dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, depression, fatigue, insomnia, vasomotor flushing, and allergic reaction may occur. Rarely ovarian enlargement and cyst formation may occur. All these effects disappear promptly after the treatment is discontinued."
Clobetasone Butyrate,"Clobetasone Butyrate is a topically active corticosteroid, which provides an exceptional combination of activity and safety. It is more effective in the treatment of eczemas than 1% Hydrocortisone, or the less active synthetic steroid preparations that are in common use. It has little effect on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function. All topical corticosteroids can cause cutaneous atrophy if grossly misused. However, study in animal and human models indicates that Clobetasone Butyrate causes less thinning of the epidermis than the other topical steroid tested.","Local atrophic changes; pigmentation changes & hypertrichosis. Increased liability to infection. Infections may be masked. Acute adrenal insufficiency. Growth retardation in child. Cushingoid symptoms. Amenorrhoea, hyperhidrosis, skin thinning"
Clobetasol Propionate + Salicylic Acid,"Clobetasol Propionate high potency corticosteroid. Corticosteroids decrease inflammation by stabilizing leukocyte lysosomal membranes, preventing release of destructive acid hydrolases from leukocytes; inhibiting macrophage accumulation in inflamed areas; reducing leukocyte adhesion to capillary endothelium; reducing capillary wall permeability and edema formation; decreasing complement components; antagonizing histamine activity and release of kinin from substrates; and reducing fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and subsequent scar tissue formation.Salicylic acid has a potent keratolytic action and a slight antiseptic action when applied topically. It softens and destroys the stratum corneum by increasing endogenous hydration which causes the horny layer of the skin to swell, soften, and then desquamate. At high concentrations, salicylic acid has a caustic effect. It also possesses weak antifungal and antibacterial activity.","As with other topical corticosteroids, prolonged use of large amounts of Clobetasol Propionate or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercortisolism. This effect is more likely to occur in infants and children, and if occlusive dressings are used. Local atrophy may occur after prolonged treatment. In rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the diseases. Clobetasol Propionate is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Possible sensitivity reactions, drying and irritation when using Salicylic Acid."
Clobetasol Propionate + Ofloxacin + Ornidazole + Terbinafine,"This cream is a combination cream which exhibits anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-protozoal & anti-inflammatory actions. Ofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that acts against many gram-positive & gram-negative bacteria. Ornidazole belongs to the nitroimidazole group of antibiotics and is used to treat amoeba and trichomonas infections. Terbinafine is an Allylamine antifungal that inhibits biosynthesis of Ergosterol (an essential components if fungal cell membrane) via inhibition of Squalene Epoxidase enzyme causing fungal cell death. Clobetasol is a potent corticosteroid which exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive properties.","Burning, itching, irritation, dry skin"
Clobetasol Propionate + Neomycin Sulphate + Nystatin,"Clobetasol Propionate is a very potent corticosteroid. It is prescribed to treat severe inflammatory skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis that have not responded to weaker corticosteroids. Neomycin Sulphate is an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside type and is used to treat infections with bacteria. Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.","As with other topical corticosteroids, prolonged use of large amount or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercortisolism. The effect is more likely to occur in infants and children and if occlusive dressings are used. Prolonged and intensive treatment with highly active corticosteroid preparations may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae, and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used, or when skin folds are involved. There are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids."
Clobetasol Propionate (Topical Preparation),"Clobetasol Propionate is a very potent topical corticosteroid. It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.","The most reported side effects are burning and stinging sensation. Less frequent adverse reactions are itching, skin atrophy, cracking and fissuring of the skin. Cushing syndrome has been reported in infants and adults as a result of prolonged use of topical Clobetasol Propionate formulations."
Clobetasol Propionate (Scalp Preparation),"Clobetasol Propionate is a very potent topical corticosteroid. It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.","As with other corticosteroids, prolonged use of large amounts or treatment of extensive areas, can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercortisolism.

In rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease. If signs of hypersensitivity appear with the use of Clobetasol Propionate Scalp Solution then application should be stopped immediately."
Clobazam,"Clobazam binds at distinct binding sites associated with the chloride ionopore at the post-synaptic GABA receptor. These GABA receptors are in various locations in the CNS (limbic, reticular formation) and clobazam increases the duration of time for which the chloride ionopore is open. As a result, hyper polarization and stabilization of the membrane occur as the post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA is enhanced.","Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Common: decreased appetitePsychiatric disorders: Common: irritability, aggression, restlessness, depression (pre-existing depression may be unmasked), drug tolerance (especially during prolonged use), agitation.Nervous system disorders: Very common: somnolence, especially at the beginning of treatment and when higher doses are used; Common: sedation, dizziness, disturbance in attention, slow speech/dysarthria/ speech disorder (particularly with high doses or in long-term treatment, and are reversible), headache, tremor, ataxia.Eye Disorders: Uncommon: diplopia (particularly with high doses or in long-term treatment and is reversible)Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Not known: respiratory depression respiratory failure (particularly in patients with pre-existing compromised respiratory function e.g. in patients with bronchial asthma or brain damage)Gastrointestinal disorders: Common: dry mouth, nausea, constipationSkin and subcutaneous disorders: Uncommon: rash; Not known: photosensitivity reaction urticaria; Steven Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (including some cases with fatal outcome);Musculoskeleteal and connective tissue disorders: Not known: muscle spasms, muscle weaknessGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Very common: fatigue, especially at the beginning of treatment and when higher doses are used. Not known: slow response to stimuli, hypothermiaInvestigations: Uncommon: weight increased (particularly with high doses or in long-term treatment)."
Clioquinol + Flumetasone Pivalate,"Flumetasone Pivalate is a potent difluorinated glucocorticoid designed for local application. It exerts an anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, vasoconstrictive and anti-proliferative effect. In inflammatory skin diseases of the external auditory meatus it affords prompt relief and eliminates symptoms such as pruritus and also reduces swelling. Clioquinol is a halogenated hydroxyquinoline derivative which exerts bacteriostatic action. It is active against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including fungi (e.g., Candida, Microsporum, Trichophyton) and Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Staphylococci). It is also effective against Gram-negative bacteria.","Occasionally burning sensation, itching or skin rash may occur. Treatment should be discontinued if severe irritation or sensitization develops."
Clindamycin + Tretinoin,"This is a combination of lincosamide antibiotic Clindamycin phosphate and retinoid Tretinoin. Clindamycin binds with the 50s ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chain by interfering with the peptidyl transfer, thereby suppressing bacterial protein synthesis. Clindamycin inhibits the activity of Propionibacterium acne as reduces the occurrence of acne. Tretinoin decreases the cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells and increases the turn over thereby brings the comedones out.","Erythema, scaling, nasopharyngitis, dry skin, cough, sinusitis and diarrhea are the common side effects."
Clindamycin + Benzoyl peroxide,"Clindamycin is a semi-synthetic derivative of lincomycin. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly binding to the 50S ribosomal subunits thus blocking the transpeptidation or translocation reactions of susceptible organisms. Benzoyl peroxide has mild keratolytic effect and antimicrobial activity which is attributed to its potent oxidizing activity. Clindamycin and Benzoyl peroxide are both active against Propionibacterium acnes, an organism associated with acne vulgaris.","Application site pain, Application site exfoliation, Application site irritation, Erythema, Burning, Pruritus, Sunburn, Scaling, Drynes, Colitis, Peelin."
Clindamycin (Vaginal Cream),"Clindamycin Phosphate is a water soluble ester that derived from the parent antibiotic Lincomycin. Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding preferentially to the 50s ribosomal subunit and affects the process of peptide chain initiation. In vitro Clindamycin is active against most strains of the following organisms that have been reported to be associated with bacterial vaginosis:

Bacteroides spp.
Gardnerella vaginalism

Possible side-effects may includes skin rash, itching, oily skin, dryness, erythema, burning, change in skin color, diarrhea, colitis, GI disturbance etc."
Conjugated Estrogen + Bazedoxifene,"This tablet pairs conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene. Conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene function by binding to and activating estrogen receptors (ER) α and β, which vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Conjugated estrogens are composed of multiple estrogens and are agonists of ER- α and β. Bazedoxifene is an estrogen agonist/antagonist that acts as an agonist in some estrogen-sensitive tissues and an antagonist in others (e.g., uterus). The pairing of conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene produces a composite effect that is specific to each target tissue. The bazedoxifene component reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia that can occur with the conjugated estrogens component.","In four prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials the common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%) were muscle spasms, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain upper, oropharyngeal pain, dizziness, and neck pain."
Conjugated Estrogen (Tablet),"Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogen in postmenopausal women.Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these gonadotropins seen in postmenopausal women.","Breast pain, tenderness or enlargement, Headache/migraine, Gut disturbances, such as nausea, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, indigestion, Legcramps, Fatigue, Weightchanges, Vaginalthrush, Depression, Anxiety, Dizziness, Changes in sex drive, Rise in blood pressure, Gall bladder disease, Swelling of the ankles due to to fluid retention (peripheral oedema), Skin reactions such as rash and itch, Steepening of corneal curvature which may make contact lenses uncomfortable, Premenstrual-like symptoms, Disturbance in liver function, Irregular brown patches on the skin, usually of the face (chloasma), Blood clots in the blood vessels."
Conjugated Estrogen (Cream),"Estrogens are important in the development and maintenance of the female urogenital system and secondary sex characteristics. They promote growth and development of the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes, and enlargement of the breasts. Indirectly, they contribute to the shaping of the skeleton, maintenance of tone and elasticity of urogenital structures, changes in the epiphyses of the long bones associated with the pubertal growth spurt and its termination, growth of axillary and pubic hair, and pigmentation of the nipples and genital tissues. However, in the preovulatory or anovulatory cycle, estrogen is the primary determinant in the onset menstruation. Eestrogen also affects the release of pituitary gonadotropins. The pharmacologic effects of conjugated estrogens are similar to those of endogenous estrogens. In responsive tissues (female urogenital organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) estrogens enter the cell and are transported into the nucleus. As a result of estrogenic activity, specific RNA and protein synthesis occurs.Osteoporosis associated with estrogen deficiency: Estrogen replacement therapy is the most effective single modality for the prevention of osteoporosis (loss of bone mass) in postmenopausal women. Estrogen reduces bone resorption and retards or halts postmenopausal bone loss. One clinical study demonstrated that even when estrogen was started as late as fifteen years after menopause, further loss of bone mass was prevented but no restoration of bone mass was observed. The effect on bone mass conservation is sustained only as long as conjugated estrogen therapy is continued. Different ethnic groups are at different risk for osteoporosis. Atrophic vaginitis and Kraurosis Vulvae: Atrophic vaginitis and Kraurosis Vulvae associated with estrogen deficiency. In the absence of estrogen stimulation, the vulvar and vaginal tissues shrink, the vaginal walls become thin and dry, and rugal folds disappear. Tenderness and pruritus, with resulting dysuria and dyspareunia, may occur. Fissures and ulcerations of tissue with spotting or bleeding may result from coitus. These changes are reversible with the administration of estrogen replacement therapy.Female Hypoestrogenism: Estrogen replacement therapy is indicated in hypoestrogenism related to female hypogonadism or primary ovarian failure. Primary ovarian failure starting early in life will lead to delayed closure of the epiphyses and retarded bone maturation. Long term estrogen deficiency in any age group will usually lead to osteoporosis (for efficacy with estrogen replacement therapy see osteoporosis). Estrogen therapy is associated with the appearance of female characteristics in these patients.","The most serious adverse reactions associated with the use of estrogen are indicated under Warnings and Precautions. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with estrogenic therapy.

Genitourinary System: Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, change in menstrual flow, amenorrhea.
Breasts: Tenderness, enlargement, secretion.
Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, bloating, cholestatic jaundice.
Skin: Chloasma or melasma which may persist when drug is discontinued, alopecia, rash.
Eyes: Steepening of the corneal curvature; intolerance to contact lenses.

Colistimethate Sodium,"Colistimethate is a surface active agent which penetrates into and disrupts the bacterial cell membrane. Colistimethate is polycationic and has both hydrophobic and lipophilic moieties. It interacts with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, changing its permeability. This effect is bactericidal. There is also evidence that polymyxins enter the cell and precipitate cytoplasmic components, primarily ribosomes.","The following adverse reactions have been reported: gastrointestinal upset, tingling of extremities and tongue, slurred speech, dizziness, vertigo and paresthesia, generalized itching, urticaria and rash, fever, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), elevated creatinine and decreased creatinine clearance, respiratory distress and apnea, nephrotoxicity and decreased urine output."
Colecalciferol [Vitamin D3],"Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) helps for the absorption & reabsorption of Calcium & Phosphorous. Vitamin D3 is essential for normal bone growth & to maintain bone density. It also reduces the severity of bacterial infection, improves lung function, prevents the risk of cancer (breast, colorectal) & helps to maintain adequate insulin levels for type 2 diabetes patients.","The general side effects are hypercalcaemia, hypercalciuria, skin rash, pruritus, urticaria, nausea, abdominal pain."
Colchicine,"An acute attack of gout apparently occurs as a result of an inflammatory reaction to crystals of monosodium urate that are deposited in the joint tissue from hyperuric body fluids; the reaction is aggravated as more urate crystals accumulate. Leukocytes migrate to the sites where urate crystals have been deposited and try to engulf the crystals by phagocytosis. As a result lactic acid and proinflammatory enzymes are released which cause inflammation with severe pain, redness, and swelling of the affected joint. Lactic acid favors a local decrease in pH that enhances uric acid deposition. Colchicine inhibits the phagocytosis of uric acid by leukocytes & also diminishes the lactic acid production directly. Thus interrupts the cycle of urate crystal deposition and inflammatory response that sustains the acute attack of gout. Colchicine is absorbed when given orally, reaching a mean Cmax of 2.5 ng/mL (range 1.1 to 4.4 ng/mL) in 1 to 2 hours after a single dose administered under fasting conditions. The mean apparent volume of distribution is approximately 5 to 8 L/kg. Colchicine binding to serum protein is low (39 ± 5%), primarily to albumin regardless of concentration. CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of Colchicine to 2-O-demethylcolchicine and 3-O-demethylcolchicine. Plasma levels of these metabolites are minimal (less than 5% of parent drug). Following multiple oral doses (0.6 mg twice daily), the mean elimination half-life is 26.6 to 31.2 hours.","Blood dyscrasias: Myelosuppression, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia have been reported. Diarrhea and pharyngolaryngeal pain may occur."
Cod Liver Oil,"Cod Liver Oil is one of the most effective providers of Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and an excellent source of Vitamin A and Vitamin D. It contains Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA: 18%) & Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA: 12%) which are been clinically proven to have positive effects on heart, bone, brain, health. They also help to nourish skin, hair, and nails.","Prolonged usage of large amounts can lead to hypervitaminosis symptoms of which include dry mouth, rough skin, painful joints swelling, fatigue, anorexia, loss of weight, vomiting and other gastrointestinal disturbances. These may disappear on discontinuation of supplementation."
Coal Tar Solution,"Polytar Scalp Shampoo is a thick, coal-tar based shampoo that soothes irritated skin on the scalp, reducing itchiness, scaling, and inflammation.These symptoms are often experienced by people with scalp psoriasis or other related skin conditions such as eczema. In these cases, a specially formulated shampoo is required, as standard shampoos often contain irritants that make the condition worse.Coal tar is proven to provide relief for psoriasis sufferers. It is a thick oil that works on patches of inflamed red skin covered in scales. It moisturises and nourishes the skin to reduce scales and dandruff, and soothes it to make it feel less itchy.This shampoo can be used by adults and children aged 12 or over.","In rare cases, Polytar Scalp Shampoo is associated with skin reactions due to allergies (rashes, swelling, difficulty breathing). Other possible rare side effects include eye irritation, hair loss, itchy and redskin, change of hair colour or texture, and burning sensations on the skin.If you are taking other medications, speak to your doctor before using this shampoo, as certain antibiotics and tranquilizers increase sensitivity to sunlight."
Coal Tar + Precipitated Sulphur + Salicylic Acid,"Coal Tar has antipruritic, keratoplastic and keratolytic properties. It slows down excessive epidermal cell turnover and is often used topically either alone or in combination with other drugs (e.g. salicyclic acid, sulfur) in conditions such as dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis.Precipitated Sulpher is converted to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) through reduction, partly by bacteria. H2S kills bacteria (possibly including Propionibacterium acnes which plays a role in acne) fungi, and parasites such as scabies mites.Salicylic Acid has a potent keratolytic action and a slight antiseptic action when applied topically. It softens and destroys the stratum corneum by increasing endogenous hydration which causes the horny layer of the skin to swell, soften, and then desquamate. At high concentrations, salicylic acid has a caustic effect. It also possesses weak antifungal and antibacterial activity.","Coal Ta ointment may occasionally cause irritation of the skin, inflammation of the hair follicles and rarely photosensitivity of the skin."
Coal Tar,"Coal tar has antipruritic, keratoplastic and keratolytic properties. It slows down excessive epidermal cell turnover and is often used topically either alone or in combination with other drugs (e.g. salicyclic acid, sulfur) in conditions such as dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis.","Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Skin irritation, photosensitivity of the skin, Coal Tar Cream may cause acne-like eruptions of the skin. There is an increased risk of skin cancer in psoriatic patients treated with a combination of Coal Tar Cream and UVB radiation has been reported. However epidemiological studies of patients treated with Coal Tar Cream on its own are inconclusive. The risk of toxicity should be taken into account when considering the prescribing this product for the patient."
Coagulation Factor VIIa [Eptacog Alfa],"Recombinant factor VIIa is a biosynthetic preparation of activated factor VII produced by recombinant DNA technology. It is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein. It promotes haemostasis by activating the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. It replaces deficient activated coagulation factor VII, which complexes with tissue factor and may activate coagulation factor X and factor IX. Factor VIIa is given as the recombinant form, eptacog alfa (activated).","Nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, fever, headache and changes in BP. Rarely, anaphylaxis."
Clozapine,"Clozapine is classified as an 'atypical' antipsychotic drug because of its profile of binding to dopamine receptors and its effects on various dopamine-mediated behaviors differ from those exhibited by other typical antipsychotic drug products. In particular, although Clozapine does interfere with the binding of dopamine at D1, D2, D3 and D5 receptors, and has a high affinity for the D4 receptor. This evidence, consistent with the view that Clozapine is preferentially more active at limbic than at striatal dopamine receptors. This may explain the relative freedom of Clozapine from extrapyramidal side effects. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and serotonergic receptors.","Common side effects are constipation, dizziness or lightheadedness (mild), drowsiness, headache (mild), increased watering of mouth, nausea or vomiting, unusual weight gain. Less common side effects include abdominal discomfort or heartburn, dryness of mouth."
Clove oil,"Clove oil is a herbal medicine which main ingredient is clove oil. It contains a large amount of eugenol that is commonly used in the treatment of oral infections and inflammation of the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Clove oil is effective, safe and well tolerated for all age groups",In concentrated form oil of clove may be irritating to mucosal tissues.
Clotrimazole + Hydrocortisone,"Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent active on dermatophytes, yeasts and other fungi. Hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid with both glucocorticoid and to a lesser extent mineralocorticoid activity. Hydrocortisone is used for replacement therapy in adrenocortical insufficiency.",Rarely local mild burning or irritation may be experienced. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
Clotrimazole (Vaginal tablet),"Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that is used for the treatment of dermal infections caused by various species of pathogenic dermatophytes, yeasts, moulds and bacteroids. Clotrimazole is also active against certain gram-positive bacteria especially Staphylococci and Tricomonas. Like other imidazoles, Clotrimazole alters the permeability of fungal cell walls by interfering with cell wall lipids. At fungi static levels the main effect is inhibition of ergosterol synthesis but at higher concentrations there is an additional mechanism of membrane damage unrelated to sterol synthesis.","Since there is practically no Clotrimazole absorption through the vaginal skin, no systemic effect is expected. The local tolerance of Clotrimazole vaginal tablet is generally good. Local irritation or burning sensation may occur in a very few cases but these symptoms are not considered harmful."
Clotrimazole (Vaginal suppository),"Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that is used for the treatment of dermal infections caused by various species of pathogenic dermatophytes, yeasts, moulds and bacteroids. Clotrimazole is also active against certain gram-positive bacteria especially Staphylococci and Tricomonas. Like other imidazoles, Clotrimazole alters the permeability of fungal cell walls by interfering with cell wall lipids. At fungi static levels the main effect is inhibition of ergosterol synthesis but at higher concentrations there is an additional mechanism of membrane damage unrelated to sterol synthesis.",Occasional skin irritation or burning sensation may occur in a very few cases which are not considered harmful.
Clotrimazole (Topical),"Clotrimazole acts primarily by damaging the permeability barrier in the cell membrane of fungi. Clotrimazole causes inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, an essential constituent of fungal cell membranes. If ergosterol synthesis is either completely or partially inhibited, the cell is no longer able to construct an intact and functional cell membrane. Because ergosterol directly promotes the growth of fungal cells in a hormone‐like fashion, rapid onset of the above events leads to dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth.Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as CYP51) is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects. These include the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, depletion of intracellular calcium, and blocking of calcium‐dependent potassium channels and voltage‐dependent calcium channels. The action of clotrimazole on these targets accounts for other effects of this drug that are separate from its antimycotic activities.","When applied topically, Clotrimazole is well tolerated.With external application, systemic effects are not observed. Local irritation or burning sensation may occur in a very few cases but these symptoms are not considered harmful."
Clotrimazole (Eye ointment),"Clotrimazole kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. It works by stopping the production of ergosterol, which is an essential component of fungal cell membranes resulting in increased membrane permeability and leakage of essential constituents of the fungal cells.",Rarely patients may experience burning or irritation immediately after applying the ointment.
Clotrimazole (Ear drop),"Clotrimazole kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. It works by stopping the production of ergosterol, which is an essential component of fungal cell membranes resulting in increased membrane permeability and leakage of essential constituents of the fungal cells.","Clotrimazole is generally well tolerated after local application but the few side effects have been reported infrequently like erythema, stinging, edema, pruritus and general irritation."
Dacomitinib,"Dacomitinib is an irreversible inhibitor of the kinase activity of the human EGFR family (EGFR/HER1, HER2, and HER4) and certain EGFR activating mutations (exon 19 deletion or the exon 21 L858R substitution mutation). In vitro dacomitinib also inhibited the activity of DDR1, EPHA6, LCK, DDR2, and MNK1 at clinically relevant concentrations. Dacomitinib demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EGFR and HER2 autophosphorylation and tumor growth in mice bearing subcutaneously implanted human tumor xenografts driven by HER family targets including mutated EGFR. Dacomitinib also exhibited antitumor activity in orally-dosed mice bearing intracranial human tumor xenografts driven by EGFR amplifications.","Most common adverse reactions (incidence >20%) are diarrhea, rash, paronychia, stomatitis, decreased appetite, dry skin, decreased weight, alopecia, cough, and pruritus."
Daclatasvir,"Daclatasvir is a direct acting antiviral agent (DAA) against the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Daclatasvir is an inhibitor of NS5A, a nonstructural protein encoded by HCV. Daclatasvir binds to the N-terminus of NS5A and inhibits both viral RNA replication and virion assembly. Characterization of Daclatasvir-resistant viruses, biochemical studies, and computer modeling data indicate that Daclatasvir interacts with the N-terminus within Domain 1 of the protein, which may cause structural distortions that interfere with NS5A functions.","The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Sofosbuvir and Amiodarone. One can get any of the following symptoms: Fainting or near-fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, not feeling well, weakness, tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, memory problems."
Dacarbazine,"Dacarbazine is a non-cell cycle specific antineoplastic agent. The exact mechanism of action by which it exerts cytotoxic effects is still unclear. However, three possible mechanisms have been postulated, including inhibition of DNA synthesis by acting as a purine analog, action as an alkylating agent, and interaction with sulfydryl group in the inhibition of bacterial cell growth.","Symptoms of anorexia, nausea and vomiting are the most frequently noted of all toxic reactions. Over 90% of patients are affected with the initial few doses. The vomiting lasts 1 to 12 hours and is incompletely and unpredictably palliated with phenobarbital and/or prochlorperazine. Rarely, intractable nausea and vomiting have necessitated discontinuance of therapy with Dacarbazine for Injection. Rarely, Dacarbazine for Injection has caused diarrhea. Some helpful suggestions include restricting the patient’s oral intake of food for 4 to 6 hours prior to treatment. The rapid toleration of these symptoms suggests that a central nervous system mechanism may be involved, and usually these symptoms subside after the first 1 or 2 days."
Dabigatran Etexilate Mesylate,"Dabigatran and its acyl glucuronides are competitive, direct thrombin inhibitors. Because thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the coagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of a thrombus. Both free and clot-bound thrombin, and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation are inhibited by the active moieties.At recommended therapeutic doses, dabigatran etexilate prolongs the coagulation markers such as aPTT, ECT, and TT. INR is relatively insensitive to the exposure to dabigatran and cannot be interpreted the same way as used for warfarin monitoring. The aPTT test provides an approximation of Dabigatran Etexilate’s anticoagulant effect. The average time course for effects on aPTT, following approved dosing regimens in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is shown in Figure 2. The curves represent mean levels without confidence intervals; variations should be expected when measuring aPTT. While advice cannot be provided on the level of recovery of aPTT needed in any particular clinical setting, the curves can be used to estimate the time to get to a particular level of recovery, even when the time since the last dose of Dabigatran Etexilate is not precisely known. In the RE-LY trial, the median (10 th to 90 th percentile) trough aPTT in patients receiving the 150 mg dose was 52 (40 to 76) seconds.","The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation
Risk of Bleeding
Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture
Thromboembolic and Bleeding Events in Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves
Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple-Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome"
D-chiro-inositol,"D-chiro-inositol is extracted by a patented process from Carob (Ceratonia siliqua) pod that mostly found in Southern Europe. Deficiency of D-chiro-inositol in peripheral tissue causes insulin resistance that leads to hyperandrogenism in ovaries which results polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). D-chiro-inositol helps to regulate the balance between androgen and estrogen by decreasing luteinizing hormone and serum testosterone level. It improves glucose tolerance and reduces circulating insulin. It reduces oxidative stress on follicle and decreases total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. D-chiro-inositol has been clinically proven as an effective treatment of ovarian cyst and PCOS associated metabolic disorders. It helps to improve and regulate normal ovulation after two weeks of administration. It also reduces hyperandrogenism related skin disorders like hirsutism, alopecia, acanthosis nigricans and acne. It lowers cardiovascular risk in women who are suffering from PCOS by controlling arterial pressure.",Well tolerated in recommended dose.
Cytarabine,Cytarabine inhibits deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis specifically at the S-phase of the cell cycle. It also has an antiviral and immunosuppressant activity.,"Nausea, vomiting, fever, rash, diarrhoea, anorexia, oral and anal inflammation or ulceration, hepatic dysfunction, headache, weakness, confusion, thrombocytopenia, fatigue."
Cyproterone Acetate + Ethinyl Estradiol,"Cyproterone is a steroid compound with potent antiandrogenic, progestogenic and antigonadotrophic activity. It exerts its antiandrogenic effect by blocking androgen receptors. It also reduces androgen synthesis by a negative feedback effect on the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian systems. The estrogen component (Ethinylestradiol) increases levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and thus reduces the free circulating plasma levels of androgens. Cyproterone has no tendency to reduce SHBG levels.If used alone in women,Cyproterone leads to menstrual cycle disturbances which are avoided when combined with Ethinylestradiol. When this tablet is administered in a cyclic manner, it has the added effect of preventing ovulation and possible conception.The components of this tablet are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Due to the long terminal half-life of Cyproterone, a 4-fold increase in plasma levels occurs after 6 to 12 days of daily dosing. Long-term therapy (36 months) with this product did not have a significant influence on lipid metabolism. A trend to increase plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels was observed. There was a slight decrease in low density lipoprotein (LDL) with a simultaneous increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL).","Common side effects are Bleeding, Dizziness, Depression, Weight gain, Headache, Edema, Breast pain, Lactation, Blood clot, Gallstones.."
Cyclosporine (Ophthalmic),"Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive agent when administered systemically. In patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, topical Cyclosporine is thought to act as a partial immunomodulator.","The most common adverse event was ocular burning. Other events reported included conjunctival hyperemia, discharge, epiphora, eye pain, foreign body sensation, pruritus, stinging, and visual disturbance (most often blurring)."
Cyclosporine,"Cyclosporine binds to cyclophilin. The complex then inhibits calcineurin which is normally responsible for activating transcription of interleukin 2. Cyclosporine also inhibits lymphokine production and interleukin release. In ophthalmic applications, the precise mechanism of action is not known. Cyclosporine emulsion is thought to act as a partial immunomodulator in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca.","Renal dysfunction; Hypertension; Tremor, headache, paraesthesia; Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, gingival hyperplasia and hepatic dysfunction; Hyperlipidaemia, hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia; Muscle cramps, myalgia and rarely muscle weakness, myopathy; Usually uncommon but anaemia, thrombocytopenia can occur; Hypertrichosis and allergic rashes."
Cyclophosphamide,Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug which is converted in the body to the active metabolites. It acts at any stage of the cell cycle. It prevents cell division by cross-linking deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strands and reducing DNA synthesis. It also exerts a potent immunosuppressive effect.,"Alopecia, skin and nails hyperpigmentation, nausea and vomiting, mucositis, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, carbohydrate metabolism disturbances, gonadal suppression, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis."
Cyclopentolate Hydrochloride,"Cyclopentolate is an anticholinergic agent that induces relaxation of the sphincter of the iris and the ciliary muscles. When applied topically to the eyes, it causes a rapid, intense cycloplegic and mydriatic effect that is maximal in 15 to 60 minutes; recovery usually occurs within 24 hours. The cycloplegic and mydriatic effects are slower in onset and longer in duration in patients who have dark pigmented irises.","Blinding acute angle-closure glaucoma and raised intraocular pressure may occur during cyclopentolate therapy. The mydriasis may be reduced by the intraocular application of pilocarpine, physostigmine or isoflurophate. Transient burning sensation of the eye is more likely with the 0.5% solution. Systemic effects, resulting from excessive absorption from mucosal surfaces or from ingestion of the drug, may include xerostomia, flushing, tachycardia and urinary retention. More severe systemic effects are tachypnea, scarlatiniform rash, delirium, psychosis, fever, stupor, coma, respiratory failure and death."
Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride,"Cyclobenzaprine, a centrally-acting skeletal muscle relaxant, is structurally related to tricyclic antidepressants, thus they share similar properties. It acts on the brain stem, decreasing tonic-somatic motor activities influencing both the α and δ motor systems. It is used as an adjunct in the symptomatic treatment of painful muscle spasms associated with musculoskeletal conditions.","The adverse reactions reported most frequently with Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride are drowsiness, dry mouth and dizziness. The incidence of these common adverse reactions is lower in the surveillance program than in the controlled clinical studies."
Cyanocobalamin,"Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) is required for the maintenance of normal erthropoiesis, nucleprotein and myelin synthesis, cell reproduction and normal growth; Coenzyme; metabolic functions include protein synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. Plays role in cell replication and hematopoiesis.","Arthralgia (12%), Dizziness (12%), Headache (12%), Nasopharyngitis (12%), Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, Congestive heart failure, Peripheral vascular disease,Pulmonary edema, Diarrhea, Dyspepsia, Polycythemia vera, Sore throat, Nervousness, Rhinitis, Glossitis, Hypoesthesia"
Crotamiton,"Crotamiton is an antiparasitic that is toxic to the scabies mite. Crotamiton also relieves itching by producing what is called a counter-irritation. As crotamiton evaporates from the skin, it produces a cooling effect. This cooling effect helps to divert your body's attention away from the itching.",Occasionally irritation of the skin or contact allergy may occur. In such cases the preparation should be discontinued.
Crizotinib,"Crizotinib is an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases including ALK, Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (HGFR, c-Met), ROS1 (c-ros), and Recepteur d'Origine Nantais (RON). Translocations can affect the ALK gene resulting in the expression of oncogenic fusion proteins. The formation of ALK fusion proteins results in activation and dysregulation of the gene’s expression and signaling which can contribute to increased cell proliferation and survival in tumors expressing these proteins. Crizotinib demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition of ALK, ROS1, and c-Met phosphorylation in cell-based assays using tumor cell lines and demonstrated antitumor activity in mice bearing tumor xenografts that expressed echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)- or nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK fusion proteins or c-Met.","The most common adverse reactions (≥25%) are vision disorders, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, edema, constipation, elevated transaminases, fatigue, decreased appetite, upper respiratory infection, dizziness, and neuropathy."
Crisaborole,"The active ingredient, Crisaborole, is a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor, mainly acting on phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), which causes inflammation. Chemically, Crisaborole is a phenoxybenzoxaborole. It contains a boron atom that helps penetrate the skin and is essential for its binding activity. Inhibition of PDE4B appears to suppress the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-23 and other cytokines, proteins believed to be involved in the immune response and inflammation.","Allergic reactions- Crisaborole may cause allergic reactions at or near the application site. These can be serious and may include hives, itching, swelling, and redness. The most common side effect of Crisaborole is application site pain, such as burning or stinging."
Desloratadine,"Desloratadine, the major active metabolite of Loratadine, is a non-sedating; long acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H1-receptor histamine antagonist activity. Desloratadine also inhibits histamine release from human mast cell.","Less common side effects may include headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, pharyngitis, dyspepsia and myalgia."
Denosumab,"Denosumab binds to Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), a transmembrane or soluble protein essential for the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. Denosumab prevents RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.","Dyspnoea, Hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ)."
Delafloxacin,Delafloxacin inhibits the activity of bacterial DNA topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II). This interferes with bacterial DNA replication by preventing the relaxation of positive supercoils introduced as part of the elongation process. The resultant strain inhibits further elongation. Delafloxacin exerts concentration-dependent bacteriocidal activity.The antibacterial activity of delafloxacin appears to best correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve of free delafloxacin to minimal inhibitory concentration (fAUC/MIC) for Gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative organisms such as Escherichia coli based on animal models of infection.,"Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥2%) are nausea, diarrhea, headache, transaminase elevations, and vomiting."
Dehydroepiandrosterone,"The sulfate derivative of DHEA has been shown to act as a noncompetitive antagonist of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, as well as a positive allosteric modulator of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. In humans, neuroprotective, antioxidant, antihypertensive, and anti-inflammatory effects have also been reported. Serum DHEA levels peak in 60 to 480 minutes after administration.","Studies in adrenal insufficiency suggest DHEA is generally well tolerated. However, data from long-term studies are lacking. Observed adverse effects include mania and hypomania, acne, hirsutism, gynecomastia, testicular changes, increased blood pressure, and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels.Use caution in individuals with psychiatric disorders; agitation, confusion, anxiety, paranoia, and suicidal thoughts have been reported. Use of hormones like DHEA may cause erythrocytosis. Use caution in individuals with diabetes, as DHEA may increase insulin resistance or sensitivity. Use caution in individuals with liver dysfunction, as DHEA may exacerbate this condition. Use caution in individuals with polycystic ovarian syndrome, as DHEA may worsen this condition."
Degarelix Acetate,"Degarelix is a selective gonadotrophin releasing-hormone (GnRH) antagonist that competitively and reversibly binds to the pituitary GnRH receptors, thereby rapidly reducing the release of the gonadotrophins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and thereby reducing the secretion of testosterone (T) by the testes. Prostatic carcinoma is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to treatment that removes the source of androgen. Unlike GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists do not induce a LH surge with subsequent testosterone surge/tumour stimulation and potential symptomatic flare after the initiation of treatment. A single dose of 240 mg degarelix, followed by a monthly maintenance dose of 80 mg, rapidly causes a decrease in the concentrations of LH, FSH and subsequently testosterone. The serum concentration of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) decreases in a similar manner to testosterone. Degarelix is effective in achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression well below medical castration level of 0.5 ng/ml. Maintenance monthly dosing of 80 mg resulted in sustained testosterone suppression in 97% of patients for at least one year. No testosterone microsurges were observed after re-injection during degarelix treatment. Median testosterone levels after one year of treatment were 0.087 ng/ml (interquartile range 0.06-0.15) N=167.","The most commonly observed adverse reactions during degarelix therapy in the confirmatory phase III study (N=409) were due to the expected physiological effects of testosterone suppression, including hot flushes and weight increase (reported in 25% and 7%, respectively, of patients receiving treatment for one year), or injection site adverse reactions. Transient chills, fever or influenza like illness were reported to occur hours after dosing (in 3%, 2% and 1% of patients, respectively).The injection site adverse reactions reported were mainly pain and erythema, reported in 28% and 17% of patients, respectively, less frequently reported were swelling (6%), induration (4%) and nodule (3%). These events occurred primarily with the starting dose whereas during maintenance therapy with the 80 mg dose, the incidence of these events pr 100 injections was: 3 for pain and <1 for erythema, swelling, nodule and induration. The reported events were mostly transient, of mild to moderate intensity and led to very few discontinuations (<1%). Serious injection site reactions were very rarely reported such as injection site infection, injection site abscess or injection site necrosis that could require surgical treatment/drainage."
Deflazacort,Deflazacort provides anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting Phospholipase A2 enzyme which is responsible for prostaglandin synthesis. Besides Deflazacort decreases the release of certain chemicals that are important in the immune system. By decreasing the release of these chemicals Deflazacort provides immunosuppressive action.,"GI disturbances, musculoskeletal, endocrine, neuropsychiatric, ophthalmic, fluid and electrolyte disturbances; susceptible to infection, impaired healing, hypersensitivity, skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, acne, myocardial rupture following recent Ml, thromboembolism."
Deferiprone,"Deferiprone is a chelating agent with an affinity for ferric ion (iron III). Deferiprone binds with ferric ions to form neutral 3:1 (deferiprone:iron) complexes that are stable over a wide range of pH values. Deferiprone has a lower binding affinity for other metals such as copper, aluminum and zinc than for iron.","Gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain are common during deferiprone treatment and may require temporary reduction in dose. A reddish brown discoloration of the urine is also common. Other adverse effects that have been reported include arthralgia and increased liver enzymes."
Deferasirox,Deferasirox is an orally active chelator that is selective for iron (as Fe3+ ). It is a tridentate ligand that binds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio. Although deferasirox has very low affinity for zinc and copper there are variable decreases in the serum concentration of these trace metals after the administration of deferasirox. The clinical significance of these decreases is uncertain.,"Serum creatinine increase, Abdominal pain, Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Proteinuria, Pyrexia, Headache, Cough , Nasopharyngitis, Pharyngolaryngeal pain, Influenza, Rash, Respiratory tract infection, Bronchitis, ALT increased, Arthralgia, back pain, Acute tonsillitis, Rhinitis, Fatigue, Ear infection, Transaminitis, Urticaria, Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, Cytopenias, including agranulocytosis, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia; leukocytoclastic vasculitis"
Daunorubicin,"Daunorubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity through a number of proposed mechanisms of action. It forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs. It inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the DNA- topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation portion of the ligation- religation reaction that topoisomerase II catalyzes. Single strand and double-strand DNA breaks result. It may also inhibit polymerase activity, affect the regulation of gene expression, and produce free radical damage to DNA. It possesses an antitumor effect against a wide spectrum of animal tumors, either grafted or spontaneous.Distribution: Daunorubicin is rapidly and widely distributed in tissues, with the highest levels in the spleen, kidneys, liver, lungs and heart. The drug binds to many cellular components, particularly nucleic acids. There is no evidence that it crosses the blood-brain barrier, but the drug apparently crosses the placenta. Metabolism and Elimination: Daunorubicin is extensively metabolized in the liver and other tissues, mainly by cytoplasmic aldo-keto reductases, producing daunorubicinol, the major metabolite which has antineoplastic activity. Approximately 40% of the drug in the plasma is present as daunorubicinol within 30 minutes and 60% in 4 hours after a dose of Daunorubicin. Further metabolism via reduction cleavage of the glycosidic bond, 4-O demethylation, and conjugation with both sulfate and glucuronide have been demonstrated. Simple glycosidic cleavage of Daunorubicin or Daunorubicinol is not a significant metabolic pathway in man. Twenty-five percent of an administered dose of Daunorubicin is eliminated in an active form by urinary excretion and an estimated 40% by biliary excretion.","Dose-limiting toxicity includes myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. Other reactions include:

Cutaneous: Reversible alopecia occurs in most patients. Rash, contact dermatitis and urticaria have occurred rarely.
Gastrointestinal: Acute nausea and vomiting occur but are usually mild. Antiemetic therapy may be of some help. Mucositis may occur 3 to 7 days after administration. Diarrhea and abdominal pain have occasionally been reported.
Local: If extravasation occurs during administration, severe local tissue necrosis, severe cellulitis, thrombophlebitis or painful induration can result.
Acute Reactions: Rarely, anaphylactoid reaction, fever, and chills can occur. Hyperuricemia may occur, especially in patients with leukemia, and serum uric acid levels should be monitored."
Dasatinib,"Dasatinib, at nanomolar concentrations, inhibits the following kinases: BCR-ABL, SRC family (SRC, LCK, YES, FYN), c-KIT, EPHA2, and PDGFRβ. Based on modeling studies, dasatinib is predicted to bind to multiple conformations of the ABL kinase. In vitro, dasatinib was active in leukemic cell lines representing variants of imatinib mesylate sensitive and resistant disease. Dasatinib inhibited the growth of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines overexpressing BCR-ABL. Under the conditions of the assays, dasatinib was able to overcome imatinib resistance resulting from BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, activation of alternate signaling pathways involving the SRC family kinases (LYN, HCK), and multi-drug resistance gene overexpression.","Reversible myelosuppression, neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, fluid retention, pulmonary arterial HTN, QT prolongation, cardiac failure, arrhythmias, HTN, musculoskeletal pain, GI disturbances, headache, chills, fatigue, asthenia, myalgia, chest pain, arthralgia, pyrexia, mucositis, flushing, colitis, electrolyte disturbances, appetite and wt disturbances, rash, dermatitis, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, acne."
Darifenacin,"Darifenacin is a potent, competitive and selective muscarinic receptor antagonist which has greater binding affinity for muscarinic M3 receptors. M3 receptors are involved in the contraction of the detrusor muscle of the bladder, GI smooth muscle, saliva production, and iris sphincter function. Darifenacin may increase volume threshold in patients with involuntary detrusor contraction, thus increase bladder capacity.","The most common side effects are dry mouth & constipation. Other less commonly reported side effects include- abnormal vision, back pain, dry skin, hypertension, vomiting, peripheral edema, weight gain, arthralgia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, rash, pruritus, urinary tract disorder and vaginitis."
Darbepoetin Alfa,"Darbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as endogenous erythropoietin. Erythropoietin interacts with progenitor stem cells to increase red cell production. Binding of erythropoietin to the erythropoietin receptor leads to receptor dimerization, which facilitates activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathways within the cytosol. Activated STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins are then translocated to the nucleus where they serve as transcription factors which regulate the activation of specific genes involved in cell division or differentiation.","Increased Mortality, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Thromboembolism; Increased Mortality and/or Increased Risk of Tumor Progression or Recurrence in Patients with cancer; Hypertension; Seizures; Serious allergic reaction; Severe Cutaneous Reactions"
Dapsone,"Dapsone has both anti-infammatory and antimicrobial properties. A combination of these activities may account for its efcacy in acne. Anti-infammatory efects include inhibition of neutrophil myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase activity, suppression of hypochlorous acid production, scavenging of reactive oxygen species, suppression of neutrophil activity, and inhibition of chemoattractant-induced signal transduction. Antimicrobial activity, similar to that of sulfones and sulfonamides, is by inhibition of bacterial dihydropteroate synthase in the folic acid metabolic pathway. This mechanism is efective against microorganisms synthesizing their own folic acid. In vitro susceptibility testing has demonstrated some activity for Dapsone against Propionibacterium species, including Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes).",Most common (incidence ≥ 0.9%) effects are application site dryness and pruritus.
Dapoxetine Hydrochloride,"The mechanism of action is thought to be related to inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin and subsequent potentiation of serotonin activity. The central ejaculatory neural circuit comprises spinal and cerebral areas that form a highly interconnected network. The sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic spinal centers, under the influence of sensory genital and cerebral stimuli integrated and processed at the spinal cord level, act in synergy to command physiologic events occurring during ejaculation. Experimental evidence indicates that serotonin (5-HT), throughout brain descending pathways, exerts an inhibitory role on ejaculation. To date, three 5-HT receptor subtypes 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(2C) have been postulated to mediate 5-HT's modulating activity on ejaculation.","Dizziness, Headache, Somnolence, Tremor, Blurred vision, Tinnitus, Sinus congestion, Nausea, Diarrhea, Abdominal pain, Dry mouth, Fatigue, Insomnia, Hypertension."
Dapagliflozin Propanediol,"Dapagliflozin is a highly potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) that improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by reducing renal glucose reabsorption leading to urinary excretion of excess glucose (glucuresis).","Renal impairment, Female genital mycotic infections, Urinary tract infection, Increased urination, Male genital mycotic infections, Dyslipidemia, Constipation, Discomfort with urination, Extremity pain, Volume depletion, Hypersensitivity"
Dantrolene Sodium,"Dantrolene produces relaxation by affecting the contractile response of the skeletal muscle at a site beyond the myoneural junction, directly on the muscle itself. In skeletal muscle, Dantrolene dissociates the excitation-contraction coupling, probably by interfering with the release of Ca++ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.","The most frequently occurring side effects of Dantrolene have been drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, general malaise, fatigue, and diarrhea. These are generally transient, occurring early in treatment, and can often be obviated by beginning with a low dose and increasing dosage gradually until an optimal regimen is established. Diarrhea may be severe and may necessitate temporary withdrawal of Dantrolene therapy. If diarrhea recurs upon readministration of Dantrolene, therapy should probably be withdrawn permanently"
Danazol,"As a gonadotropin inhibitor, danazol suppresses the pituitary-ovarian axis possibly by inhibiting the output of pituitary gonadotropins. Danazol also depresses the preovulatory surge in output of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thereby reducing ovarian estrogen production. Danazol may also directly inhibits ovarian steroidogenesis; bind to androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors; bind to sex-hormone-binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin; and increases the metabolic clearance rate of progesterone. Another mechanism of action by which danazol may use to facilitate regression of endometriosis is by decreasing IgG, IgM, and IgA concentrations, as well as phospholipid and IgG isotope autoantibodies. In the treatment of endometriosis, as a consequence of suppression of ovarian function, danazol causes both normal and ectopic endometrial tissues to become inactive and atrophic. This leads to anovulation and associated amenorrhea. In fibrocystic breast disease, the exact mechanism of action of danazol is unknown, but may be related to suppressed estrogenic stimulation as a result of decreased ovarian production of estrogen. A direct effect on steroid receptor sites in breast tissue is also possible. This leads to a disappearance of nodularity, relief of pain and tenderness, and possibly changes in the menstrual pattern. In terms of hereditary angioedema, danazol corrects the underlying biochemical deficiency by increasing serum concentrations of the deficient C1 esterase inhibitor, resulting in increased serum concentrations of the C4 component of the complement system.","Oedema, weight gain, sweating, acne, hirsutism, flushing, oily skin or hair, deepening of the voice, clitoral hypertrophy, amenorrhoea, hepatic dysfunction, CNS or GI disturbances, benign intracranial hypertension, reduction in breast size, visual disturbances, elevated LFT values."
Dalteparin Sodium,"Dalteparin Na is an antithrombotic agent, which acts mainly through its ability to potentiate the inhibition of factor Xa and thrombin by antithrombin. It has a relatively higher ability to potentiate factor Xa inhibition than to prolong aPTT.","Elevated serum transaminase levels (AST and ALT), allergic reactions (e.g. pruritus, rash, fever, inj site reaction, bullous eruption), pain on inj site. Epidural or spinal haematomas that may result in permanent paralysis, severe haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia."
Dextromethorphan + Pseudoephedrine + Triprolidine,"This preparation is a mixture of antitussive, decongestant and antihistamine agent. Dextromethorphan is a safe, effective, non-narcotic antitussive agent which has a central action on the cough centre in the medulla. Although structurally related to Morphine, it has no analgesic and habit forming properties and in general it has little sedative activity. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passage.

Dextran + Sodium Chloride,"Dextran produce expansion of plasma volume. It also reduces blood viscosity and inhibits sludging or aggregation of red blood cells.Sodium chloride is the major extracellular cation. It is important in electrolyte and fluid balance, osmotic pressure control and water distribution as it restores sodium ions. It is used as a source of electrolytes and water for hydration, treatment of metabolic acidosis, priming solution in haemodialysis and treatment of hyperosmolar diabetes. It is also used as diluents for infusion of compatible drug additives.","GI disturbances; headache, dizziness; allergic reactions; raised liver enzyme values; alopecia; bone marrow suppression."
Dextran + Hypromellose,"Dextran & Hypromellose combination Eye drops acts like natural tears, which provides smoothing relief to dry, itchy, burning and irritated eyes. It helps eyes to stay moisthealthy and protects against further irritation. This unique combination of ingredients works together to retain moisture on the eye and slow evaporation of the tear film.Hypromellose promotes corneal wetting by stabilizing and thickening the precorneal tear film and prolonging the tear film breakup time, which is usually shortened in dry eye conditions. Also acts to lubricate and protect the eye. Dextran is a complex branched glucan composed of chains of varying lengths. It is used medicinally as an antithrombotic, to reduce blood viscosity, and as a volume expander in hypovolaemia.","There are no known side effects with the use of it, however, if the patient experiences any reaction in eye or other part of the body after using this medication then consult with doctor"
Dextran + Dextrose,"Dextrans produce expansion of plasma volume. It also reduces blood viscosity and inhibits sludging or aggregation of red blood cells.Dextrose is a monosaccharide that is used as a source of calories and water for hydration. It helps to reduce loss of body protein and nitrogen. It also promotes glycogen deposition in the liver.

Dexpanthenol,"Dexpanthenol is an alcohol derivative of pantothenic acid, a component of the B complex vitamins and an essential component of a normally functioning epithelium. Dexpanthenol is enzymatically cleaved to form pantothenic acid, which is an essential component of Coenzyme A, which acts as a cofactor in many enzymatic reactions that are important for protein metabolism in the epithelium.Dermatological effects of the topical use of dexpanthenol include increased fibroblast proliferation and accelerated re-epithelialization in wound healing. Furthermore, it acts as a topical protectant, moisturizer, and has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties","As with any medicine, use of Dexpanthenol may cause side effects in some users. Do not be alarmed by the list of side effects. You may not suffer from any of them. Discontinue use and refer to a doctor immediately in the event of: Allergic reaction and/or allergic skin reaction such as: atopic dermatitis, allergic dermatitis, pruritus, redness, rash, eczema, urticaria, local irritation or blistering.

Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride,"Dexmedetomidine is a specific and selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist. By binding to the presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors, it inhibits the release if norepinephrine, therefore, terminate the propagation of pain signals. Activation of the postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors inhibits the sympathetic activity decreases blood pressure and heart rate.","The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were hypotension, respiratory depression, and bradycardia."
Dexlansoprazole,"Dexlansoprazole delayed-release capsule is a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) which suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the (H+/K+)-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. By acting specifically on the proton pump, Dexlansoprazole blocks the final step of acid production. It is the R-enantiomer of lansoprazole (A racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers). Dexlansoprazole is supplied as a Dual Delayed Release (DDR) formulation in a capsule for oral administration. This capsule contains a mixture of two types of enteric coated granules with different pH-dependent dissolution profiles. The dual delayed release formulation in dexlansoprazole, plasma concentration-time profile with two distinct peaks; the first peak occurs 1 to 2 hours after administration, followed by a second peak within 4 to 5 hours. After oral administration, mean Cmax and AUC value of Dexlansoprazole increased approximately dose proportionally. Dexlansoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreated by urine.","Common side effects: Diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting & flatulence."
Dexketoprofen,"Dexketoprofen is the S(+)-enantiomer of Ketoprofen and is responsible for the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of Ketoprofen. The inactive R(-)-enantiomer does not contribute to the therapeutic properties of Ketoprofen but adds to the metabolic load. Dexketoprofen has been formulated as a trometamol salt. Its high solubility in water means a rapid absorption through the gut wall which results in a more rapid onset of action than Ketoprofen. Peak plasma concentrations are attained more quickly than other widely used analgesics with an onset of action of 30 minutes. Dexketoprofen trometamol, given as a tablet, is rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of between 0.25 and 0.75 hours, whereas the tmax for the S-enantiomer after the racemic drug, administered as tablets or capsules prepared with the free acid, is between 0.5 and 3 hours. Peak plasma concentrations of 1.4 and 3.1 mg/L are reached after administration of Dexketoprofen trometamol 12.5 and 25 mg, respectively. From 70 to 80% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine during the first 12 hours, mainly as the acyl-glucuronoconjugated parent drug. No R(-)-Ketoprofen is found in the urine after administration of Dexketoprofen [S(+)-Ketoprofen], confirming the absence of bioinversion of the S(+)-enantiomer in humans. The anti-inflammatory potency of Dexketoprofen was always equivalent to that demonstrated by twice the dose of Ketoprofen.","As with all medicines, Dexketoprofen 25 mg tablets may cause some unwanted effects in some patients. These are described below and are characteristic of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs: 

Common (1-10%): nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain or heartburn.
Uncommon (0.1-1%): sleep disorders, nervousness, headache, dizziness, vertigo, palpitations, constipation, dry mouth, flatulence, skin rash, fatigue, hot flushes, shivering, general malaise.
Rare (0.01 0.1%): stomach ulceration, gastric haemorrhage or perforation; pins and needles, high blood pressure, water retention, slowed breathing rate, hepatic enzymes increased, increased sweating.
Very rare/isolated cases (<0.01%): blurred vision, ringing in the ear, low blood pressure, haematological reactions, hepatic or renal damage, dermatological and photosensitivity reactions, bronchospasm or anaphylaxis.
In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or mixed connective tissue disease, antiinflammatory medicines may rarely cause isolated cases of fever, headache and rigidity of the nape (back of the neck)."
Dexibuprofen,"Dexibuprofen (S (+)-ibuprofen) is considered as the pharmacologically active enantiomer of racemic ibuprofen. Like racemic ibuprofen, Dexibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic action. Like ibuprofen, Dexibuprofen acts by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.Pharmacokinetics: Dexibuprofen is absorbed primarily from the small intestine. After metabolic transformation in the liver (hydroxylation, carboxylation) the pharmacologically inactive metabolites are completely excreted, mainly by the kidneys (90%), but also in the bile. The elimination half-life is 1.8-3.5 hours; the plasma protein binding is about 99%. Maximum plasma levels are reached about 2 hours after oral administration. The administration of dexibuprofen with a meal delays the time to reach maximum concentrations (from 2.1 hours after fasting conditions to 2.8 hours after non-fasting conditions) and decreases the maximum plasma concentrations (from 20.6 to 18.1 mcg/ml, which is of no clinical relevance), but has no effect on the extent of absorption.","Clinical experience has shown that adverse effects of Dexibuprofen are similar to those of racemic ibuprofen. Common side-effects are dyspepsia, diarrhea, fatigue, and headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypersensitivity reactions - bleeding, ulcer."
Dexamethasone + Tobramycin,"Like other amino-glycosides, the bactericidal activity of Tobramycin is accomplished by specific inhibition of normal protein synthesis in susceptible bacteria, but at the present time, very little is known about this action. It is thought that inhibition of protein synthesis is due to an action on ribosome that causes bacterial misreading of messenger RNA. The action of Dexamethasone is to inhibit the phospholipase A2, the first step in prostaglandin synthesis. Also Dexamethasone inhibits the chemo-tactic infiltration of neutrophils into the site of inflammation. The result is that its anti-inflammatory activity is 25 times greater and its overall therapeutic effectiveness 8-10 times greater than that of hydrocortisone.","The most frequent side effects to topical ocular Tobramycin are localized ocular toxicity and hypersensitivity, including lid itching and swelling and conjuntival erythema. The reactions due to the steroid component are elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage, posterior subcapsule cataract formation."
Dexamethasone + Neomycin Sulphate + Polymyxin B Sulphate,"Dexamethasone (Corticosteroids) suppress inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticosteroid may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant in a particular case. The anti-infective component in the combination is included to provide action against specific organisms susceptible to it. Neomycin Sulphate is considered active against the following microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Streptococcus Viridans, Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Haemophilus influenzae. Polymyxin B Sulphate is considered active against the following microorganism: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aerobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Koch-Weeks bacillus.When a decision to administer both a corticosteroid and an antimicrobial is made, the administration of such drugs in combination has the advantage of greater patient compliance and convenience, with the added assurance that the appropriate dosage of both drugs is administered, plus assured compatibility of ingredients when both types of drugs are in the same formulation and, particularly, that the correct volume of drug is delivered and retained.","Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available since no denominator of treated patients is available. Reactions occurring most often from the presence of the anti-infective ingredient are allergic sensitizations. The reactions due to the steroid component in decreasing order of frequency are: elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage, posterior sub-capsular cataract formation and delayed wound healing."
Dexamethasone + Chloramphenicol,Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid. It has an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic action. It is used topically in the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the anterior segment of the eye. Dexamethasone is absorbed rapidly after oral administration with a half-life of about 190 minutes. Sufficient absorption may occur after topical application to the skin and eye to produce systemic effects.Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotic active against a wide variety of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Chloramphenicol exerts its antibacterial effect by binding to bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis at an early stage,"Adverse reactions seen with Chloramphenicol are transient ocular burning or discomfort and other reported reactions include stinging, redness, itching, conjunctivitis, foreign body sensation, photophobia, blurred vision, dryness and eye pain. Allergic sensitization may occur with the local use of Chloramphenicol. Elevation of intraocular pressure with possible development of glaucoma, infrequent optic nerve damage and posterior subcapsular cataract formation."
Dexamethasone (Ophthalmic),Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid which decreases inflammation by inhibiting the migration of leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It suppresses normal immune response.,"Glaucoma with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, perforation of the globe. Rarely, stinging and burning may occur."
Dexamethasone,Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid which decreases inflammation by inhibiting the migration of leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It suppresses normal immune response.,"The following adverse reactions have been associated with prolonged systemic glucocorticoid therapy.Endocrine and metabolic disturbances: Cushing-like syndrome, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, premature epiphyseal closure, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness, decreased glucose tolerance, negative nitrogen and calcium balance.Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Sodium and fluid retention, hypertension, potassium loss, hypokalaemic alkalosis.Musculo-skeletal effects: Myopathy, abdominal distension, osteoporosis, aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads.Gastro-intestinal effects: Gastric and duodenal ulceration, perforation and haemorrhage.Dermatological effects: Impaired wound healing, skin atrophy, striae, petechiae and ecchymoses, bruising, facial erythema, increased sweating, acne.Central Nervous System effects: Psychic disturbances ranging from euphoria to frank psychotic manifestations,convulsions,in children pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) with vomiting and papilloedema.Ophthalmic effects: Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, posterior subcapsular cataracts.Immunosuppressive effects: Increased susceptibility to infections, decreased responsiveness to vaccination and skin tests."
Desvenlafaxine,"Desvenlafaxine is the principal active metabolite of venlafaxine. The exact mechanism is unknown, but is thought to be related to the potentiation of serotonin and norepinephrine in the CNS, through inhibition of their reuptake.","Suicidal thinking/ behaviour, HTN, mydriasis, seizure, hyponatraemia, interstitial lung disease and eosinophilic pneumonia; nausea, dizziness, insomnia, hyperhidrosis, constipation, somnolence, decreased appetite, anxiety, sexual function disorders in males (e.g. anorgasmia, decreased libido, abnormal orgasm, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, ejaculation failure, sexual dysfunction)."
Desonide,"Desonide gel contains Desonide which is a synthetic nonfluorinated corticosteroid for topical dermatologic use. Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. Corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.","The most common local side effects are burning, rash and pruritus at the application site. The following additional local side effects have been reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids. They may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings, especially with higher potency corticosteroids: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria."
Desmopressin Acetate,"By mimicking the actions of endogenous ADH, desmopressin acts as a selective agonist of V2 receptors expressed in the renal collecting duct (CD) to increase water re-absorption and reduce urine production. Desmopressin has been shown to be more potent than ADH in increasing plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease Type I. Desmopressin demonstrates markedly diminished pressor activity. Desmopressin administered intranasally has an antidiuretic effect about one-tenth that of an equivalent dose administered by injection.Upon binding of desmopressin to V2 receptors in the basolateral membrane of the cells of the distal tubule and collecting ducts of the nephron, adenylyl cyclase is stimulated. The resulting intracellular cascades in the collecting duct lead to increased rate of insertion of water channels, called aquaporins, into the lumenal membrane and enhanced the permeability of the membrane to water.","Side-effects include headache, stomach pain and nausea. Isolated cases of allergic skin reactions and more severe general allergic reactions have been reported. Very rare cases of emotional disorders including aggression in children have been reported. Treatment with desmopressin without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to water retention/hyponatraemia with accompanying symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, weight gain, decreased serum sodium and in serious cases, convulsions."
Difluprednate,"Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and may delay or slow healing. They inhibit edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Difluprednate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids.","Adverse reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera. Ocular adverse reactions occurring with Difluprednate included corneal edema, ciliary and conjunctival hyperemia, eye pain, photophobia, posterior capsule opacification, anterior chamber cells, anterior chamber flare, conjunctival edema, and blepharitis for patient with ocular surgery."
Diflorasone Diacetate,"Like other topical corticosteroids, Diflorasone Diacetate has anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.","The following adverse effects have been reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids. These reactions include burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infections, skin atrophy, striae and miliaria."
Diethylcarbamazine Citrate,"The mechanism of action of diethylcarbamazine is thought to involve sensitizing the microfilariae to phagocytosis. One study showed that diethylcarbamazine's activity against Brugia malayi microfilariae is dependent on inducible nitric-oxide synthase and the cyclooxygenase pathway. It confirmed the important role of the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway in diethylcarbamazine's mechanism of action in vivo and showes that in addition to its effects on the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, it targets the cyclooxygenase pathway and COX-1.","Fever, headache, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, chills.Potentially Fatal: Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur especially in the treatment of onchocerciasis where rare Mazzotti reaction characterised by rash, itching, headache, muscle and joint pains, tachycardia, postural hypotension may start within 2 hr of drug administration. Encephalitis and retinal haemorrhage."
Dienogest + Estradiol Valerate,COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation. Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation.,"The most common adverse reactions (≥2%) in clinical trials for Natazia are headache (including migraines) 13%, breast pain 7%, menstrual disorders 7%, nausea or vomiting 6%, acne 4%, mood changes (3%) and increased weight 3%."
Dienogest,"Dienogest acts as an agonist at the progesterone receptor (PR) with weak affinity that is comparable to that of progesterone but has a very potent progestagenic effect in the endometrium, causing endometrial atrophy after prolonged use. It promotes antiproliferative, immunologic and antiangiogenic effects on endometrial tissue. Dienogest reduces the level of endogenous production of oestradiol and thereby suppressing the trophic effects of oestradiol on both the eutopic and ectopic endometrium. Continous administration of dienogest results in hyperprogestogenic and moderately hypoestrogenic endocrine environment, which causes initial decidualization of endometrial tissue. It is an antagonist at androgen receptors, improve androgenic symptoms such as acne and hirsutism [A16570].","Undesirable effects are more common during the 1st months after start of intake of Dienogest, and subside with duration of treatment. The following undesirable effects have been reported in users of Dienogest. The most frequently reported undesirable effects during treatment that were considered at least possibly related to Dienogest were headache (9%), breast discomfort (5.4%), depressed mood (5.1%) and acne (5.1%).

Dicycloverine Hydrochloride,"Dicycloverine hydrochloride is an antispasmodic and anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agent. Chemically, it is [Bicyclohexyl-]1-carboxylic acid, 2-(diethylammo) ethyl ester, hydrochloride. Dicycloverine relieves smooth muscle spasm of the gastrointestinal tract. Dicycloverine HCl Injection is a sterile, pyrogen-free, aqueous solution for intramuscular injection (Not For Intravenous Use). It works at specific receptors, called cholinergic (or muscarinic) receptors, located on the involuntary muscle in the walls of the gut. By binding to these receptors dicycloverine prevents certain chemicals produced by the body from interacting with these receptors. This causes the gut muscle to relax, relieving the pain of colic produced by gut muscle contraction and spasm.","Insomnia, mydriasis, cycloplegia, increased ocular tension, urinary hesitancy, palpitations, dyspnea."
Diclofenac Sodium + Misoprostol,"It is a combination product containing Diclofenac Sodium, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic properties and Misoprostol, a gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal protective prostaglandin E 1 analog. The mechanism of action of Diclofenac Sodium, like other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal may lead to diminish bicarbonate and mucosal secretion and may contribute to mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucous production & prevents gastric and duodenal ulcers.","The most common reported side effects are abdominal pain, diarrhea and other GI symptoms. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to  severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving Misoprostol."
Diclofenac Sodium + Methyl Salicylate + Linseed Oil + Menthol,"Diclofenac Diethylamine is systemically absorbed through the skin; it inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase, thus reducing the formation of PGE2. Moreover, it also increases the uptake of Arachidonic acid into the cellullar pool. Menthol is a vasodilator. It dilates the blood vessels, produces a feeling of coolness and produces analgesia. Methyl salicylate is a known anti-inflammatory agent.",Usually well tolerated. Extremely low frequency of hypersensitivity reactions.
Diclofenac Sodium + Lidocaine Hydrochloride,"Diclofenac Sodium is a potent nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) with marked analgesic and antipyretic properties. It also has some uricosuric effects. The action of Diclofenac appeared to be associated with the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Diclofenac may inhibit synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyses the formation of prostaglandin precursors from arachidonic acid. Peak plasma concentration is achieved within half an hour following injection. Lidocaine is the most widely used local anaesthetic drug. It acts more rapidly and is more stable than most other local anaesthetics. It is a very useful surface anaesthetic. Like other local anaesthetics, Lidocaine impairs the generation and conduction of nerve impulses by slowing depolarization. The onset of anaesthesia of Lidocaine Hydrochloride is more rapid and the duration is 1-2 hours.","Side effects to Diclofenac Sodium and Lidocaine injection are usually mild and transient. However if serious side effects occur the injection should be discontinued. Gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, diarrhea and occasionally bleeding may occur. In very rare instances, injection site disorder may occur. In isolated cases, abscesses and local necrosis may occur. The adverse effects due to Lidocaine mainly involve the CNS, are usually of short duration, and are dose related. The CNS reactions may be manifested by drowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, confusion, lightheadedness etc."
Diclofenac Sodium (Ophthalmic),"Diclofenac Eye Drops contains Diclofenac Sodium, a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic property. Diclofenac Sodium produces anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity with a reduction in the tissue prostaglandin ( such as PgE2 and Pg F2α) .","Mild to moderate burning sensation in 5-15% patients which is transient in nature and almost never necessitated discontinuation of treatment. Other less common side-effects are sensitivity to light, bad taste, feeling of pressure, allergic reactions etc."
Diclofenac Sodium,"Dilofenac Sodium is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with pronounced anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. It has also some uricosuric effect. Diclofenac exerts its effect by inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis which plays a major role in causing inflammation, pain and fever. Diclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract when taken with or after meal. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within an average of 2 hours after ingestion of it. At therapeutic concentrations, it is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins. Diclofenac is metabolized in the liver and undergoes first pass metabolism.","Diclofenac Sodium is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects are mild, rare and transient. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may be sometimes complaining of epigastric pain, eructation, nausea and diarrhea or dizziness or headache. These effects are usually mild in nature. Peripheral edema and skin reactions, such as rash and eczema have also been encountered. Diclofenac Sodium Gel may cause local irritation and reddening of the skin and skin rash."
Diclofenac Potassium,"The mechanism of action of Diclofenac Potassium, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.","Side-effects of Diclofenac are usually mild and transient. However, if serious side-effects occur. Diclofenac should be discontinued. Occasional: epigastric pain, other gastro-intestinal disorders (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dyspepsia,flatulence,anorexia). Rare: gastro-intestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer (with or without bleeding or perforation), bloody diarrhoea."
Diclofenac Diethylamine + Mephenesin + Menthol + Methyl Salicylate + Turpentine Oil,"Diclofenac Diethylamine, Mephenesin, Menthol, Methyl Salicylate, Turpentine oil works by reducing pain and delayed onset muscle soreness; relieving pruritus; providing relief from painful conditions; providing relief of musculoskeletal aches and pains; reducing the pain.","The most commonly reported side-effects of this gel are itching, blisters, allergic contact dermatitis, anaphylactic reactions, pruritus, and rash."
Diazoxide,"As a diuretic, Diazoxide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-CI cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like Diazoxide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of Diazoxide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle. As a antihypoglycemic, Diazoxide inhibits insulin release from the pancreas, probably by opening potassium channels in the beta cell membrane.Pharmacodynamics: Diazoxide is a potassium channel activator. Its mechanism of action revolves around enhancing cell membrane permeability to potassium ions. This action consequently elicits the relaxation of local smooth muscles. This switches off voltage-gated calcium ion channels which inhibits the generation of an action potential.","The adverse reactions are thrombocytopenia, pancreatitis, hypotension, diarrhea, heart failure etc."
Diazepam,"Diazepam attaches to the specific site on the GABA receptor and potentiates the effect of GABA, which acts by opening chloride ion channels into cells.Diazepam is absorbed rapidly and completely after oral administration. Peak Plasma concentration reaches within 15-90 minutes. Mean plasma half-life is 30 hours. Plasma protein binding is 98-99%. Diazepam is metabolized in the liver with only traces of the unchanged drug excreted in urine. A very small proportion of the metabolites is excreted through the bile into the intestine and eliminated with the feces. After rectal administration in suppository form diazepam is significantly absorbed and peak concentration reaches within 1.5-2 hours.","Diazepam is generally well tolerated. Higher doses may cause somnolence, dizziness, light headedness, confusion and ataxia."
Diabasic Sodium Phosphate + Monobasic Sodium Phosphate,"It acts as a saline laxative when administered by the rectal route. Fluid accumulation in the lower bowel produces distension and promotes peristalsis and bowel movement on the rectum, sigmoid and descending colon. These phenomena results in rapid evacuation.","Phosphate Enema is well tolerated when used as indicated. However, adverse events possibly associated with the use of phosphate enema have been infrequently reported. In some cases, adverse events may occur, especially if the enema is misused."
Dextrose & Hartmann's Solution,"This is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution for fluid and electrolyte replenishment and caloric supply in a single dose container for intravenous administration.","Allergic reactions or anaphylactoid symptoms such as localized or generalized urticaria and pruritus; periorbital, facial, and/or laryngeal edema, coughing, sneezing, and/or difficulty with breathing have been reported during administration. The reporting frequency of these signs and symptoms is higher in women during pregnancy."
Dextrose,"Dextrose is a form of glucose (sugar). Dextrose 5% in water is injected into a vein through an IV to replace lost fluids and provide carbohydrates to the body. Dextrose 5% in water is used to treat low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), insulin shock, or dehydration (fluid loss). Dextrose 5% in water is also given for nutritional support to patients who are unable to eat because of illness, injury, or other medical condition.","severe burning, pain, or swelling around the IV needle;
warmth, redness, oozing, or bleeding where the IV was placed;
fever, ongoing cough;
high blood sugar, headache, trouble concentrating, memory problems, weakness, feeling unsteady, hallucinations, fainting, seizure, shallow breathing or breathing that stops;
low potassium or anxiety, sweating, pale skin, severe shortness of breath, wheezing, pain, fast or uneven heart rate."
Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Guaifenesin,This tablet is a combination of Guaifenesin and Dextromethorphan HBr. Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant and gives relief from cough by blocking the cough centre in the brain. Guaifenesin is an expectorant. It reduces the viscosity of cough by increasing the flow of fluids in the bronchial secretion thereby facilitating the expectoration of cough.,"Common side effects are hypersensitivity, rash, nausea & vomiting."
Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide,"Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex by a direct action on the cough center in the medulla of the brain. Dextromethorphan shows high affinity binding to several regions of the brain, including the medullary cough center. This compound is an NMDA receptor antagonist and acts as a non-competitive channel blocker. It is one of the widely used antitussives, and is also used to study the involvement of glutamate receptors in neurotoxicity.","Adverse effects with Dextromethorphan are rare, but nausea and dizziness sometimes occur. The drug produces no analgesia or addiction and little or no CNS depression. Excitation, confusion and respiratory depression may occur after overdosage."
Donepezil Hydrochloride,"Donepezil Hydrochloride is a centrally acting anticholinesterase agent. It binds reversibly with acetylcholinesterase and inactivates it, thus inhibiting hydrolysis of acetylcholine. As a result the concentration of acetylcholine increases at cholinergic synapses in the brain.","Generally well tolerated but some patients may experience nausea, vomiting & diarrhoea. These adverse events are of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued treatment without the need for dose modification. Less frequent side effects are insomnia, fatigue, anorexia, muscle cramps, generalized seizure etc."
Domperidone Maleate,"Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.","Domperidone may produce hyperprolactinemia (1.3%).This may result in galactorrhea, breast enlargement, and soreness and reduced libido. Dry mouth (1%), thirst, headache (1.2%), nervousness, drowsiness (0.4%), diarrhea (0.2%), skin rash and itching (0.1%) may occur during treatment with domperidone. Extra-pyramidal reactions are seen in 0.05% of patients in clinical studies."
Docusate Sodium (Oral),"Docusate sodium works by allowing more water to be absorbed by the stool. Docusate does not stay in the gastrointestinal tract, but is absorbed into the bloodstream and excreted via the gallbladder after undergoing extensive metabolism. The effect of docusate may not necessarily be all due to its surfactant properties. Perfusion studies suggest that docusate inhibits fluid absorption or stimulates secretion in the portion of the small intestine known as the jejunum.","Rarely, Docusate Sodium softgel capsules can cause diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps or skin rash."
Docusate Sodium (Ear drop),"Ear wax which often obstructs the external auditory meatus of the ear contains less than 50% of fatty matter derived from secretions of the sebaceous ceruminous glands. The majority of the wax consists of desquamated epithelium, foreign matter and shed hairs. This non-fatty material forms a matrix holding together the granules of fatty matter to form the ceruminous mass. The addition of oils or solvents binds the mass more firmly together, but aqueous solutions, if they are able to penetrate the matrix, cause a disintegration of the ceruminous mass. Docusate Sodium ear drops, because of their low surface tension and miscibility, rapidly penetrate the dry matrix of the ceruminous mass, reducing the solid ear wax to a semi-solid debris.",Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity/allergic reactions; Skin disorders: contact dermatitis and allergic skin reactions; General disorders: Application site reactions rarely including transient stinging or irritation may occur.
Docetaxel Trihydrate,"Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent, which acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells that is essential for vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel promotes the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly. Docetaxel binds to free tubulin thereby decreasing the critical intracellular concentration of tubulin. The promoted polymerization of microtubules leads to the production of microtubule bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of microtubules, resulting in the inhibition of mitosis in cells. The binding of Docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments in the bound microtubules; in that, it differs from other spindle poisons. Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumor cell lines, and against freshly excised human tumor cells in clonogenic assays. In addition, Docetaxel was found to be active on a number of cell lines overexpressing the p-glycoprotein, which is encoded by the multidrug resistant gene.","The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice."
Dobutamine,"Dobutamine exerts positive inotropic effect on the myocardium by stimulating β1-adrenergic receptors, thereby increasing myocardial contractility, stroke vol and cardiac output.","Increased Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, And Ventricular Ectopic Activity: A 10- to 20-mm increase in systolic blood pressure and an increase in heart rate of 5 to 15 beats/minute have been noted in most patients (see WARNINGS regarding exaggerated chronotropic and pressor effects). Approximately 5% of patients have had increased premature ventricular beats during infusions. These effects are dose related.Hypotension: Precipitous decreases in blood pressure have occasionally been described in association with dobutamine therapy. Decreasing the dose or discontinuing the infusion typically results in rapid return of blood pressure to baseline values. In rare cases, however, intervention may be required and reversibility may not be immediate.Reactions At Sites Of Intravenous Infusion: Phlebitis has occasionally been reported. Local inflammatory changes have been described following inadvertent infiltration. Isolated cases of cutaneous necrosis (destruction of skin tissue) have been reported.Miscellaneous Uncommon Effects: The following adverse effects have been reported in 1% to 3% of patients: nausea, headache, anginal pain, nonspecific chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath. Isolated cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported.Administration of dobutamine, like other catecholamines, can produce a mild reduction in serum potassium concentration, rarely to hypokalemic levels.Longer-Term Safety: Infusions of up to 72 hours have revealed no adverse effects other than those seen with shorter infusions."

Disopyramide Phosphate,"Disopyramide’s Class 1a activity is similar to that of quinidine in that it targets sodium channels to inhibit conduction. Disopyramide depresses the increase in sodium permeability of the cardiac Myocyte during Phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, in turn decreasing the inward sodium current. This results in an increased threshold for excitation and a decreased upstroke velocity. Disopyramide prolongs the PR interval by lengthening both the QRS and P wave duration. This effect is particularly well suited in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia as it slows the action potential propagation through the atria to the ventricles. Disopyramide does not act as a blocking agent for beta or alpha adrenergic receptors, but does have a significant negative inotropic effect on the ventricular myocardium. As a result, the use of disopyramide may reduce contractile force up to 42% at low doses and up to 100% in higher doses leading to heart failure.This provides a possible treatment for atrial and ventricular fibrillation, as it restores pacemaker control of the tissue to the SA and AV nodes","Usually Disopyramide is well tolerated but occasionally in some cases dry mouth/ nose/ eye, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloating, blurred vision, urinary problems, headache, skin rash, dizziness, nervousness & impotence (1-3%) may occur."

The drug is often active against penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and against strains of those organisms that are resistant to other Tetracyclines. Certain Gram-negative strains of E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella, which are often resistant to Tetracycline, may be sensitive to Doxycycline. In addition, 70-90% of the various anaerobes are sensitive to Doxycycline and Bacteroides fragilis is more likely to be sensitive to Doxycycline than to other tetracyclines.Doxycycline is active against most strains of Haemophilus influenzaeand is particularly useful for infections with H. ducreyi, Actinomyces, Brucella and Vibrio cholerae. It is also active against Nocardia, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and a wide range of Rickettsiae. Doxycycline is active against spirochetes such as Borellia recurrentis, Treponema pallidum and Treponema pertenue. It is also active against Plasmodium falciparum.","Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, skin rashes, hemolytic anaemia, eosinophilia may be reported."
Doxorubicin Hydrochloride,Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic. The cytotoxic action results from its binding to DNA and inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis. Doxorubicin has been shown to produce regression in a variety of disseminated malignancies.,"Leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea. Rarely facial flushing, rash, alopecia. Blurred vision, headache, seizures, paraesthesia, confusion, malaise, lethargy, skin pigmentation."
Doxophylline,"Doxophylline is a novel bronchodilator. It structurally differs from Theophylline due to the presence of a dioxolane group in position 7. Doxophylline selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 thereby relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. However, differently from Theophylline, Doxophylline appears to have decreased affinities toward adenosine A1 and A2 receptors, which may account for the better safety profile of the drug. Doxophylline is reported to inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) and generation of leukotriene production.","Doxophylline rarely causes serious side effects, however possible side effects are similar for taking excess amount of caffeine. These include: nausea, vomiting, headache, upset stomach and heartburn."
Doxepin (Topical),"Doxepin hydrochloride is one of a class of agents known as dibenzoxepin tricyclic antidepressant compounds. Although doxepin HCl does have H1 and H2 histamine receptor blocking actions, the exact mechanism by which doxepin exerts its antipruritic effect is unknown. It can produce drowsiness in significant numbers of patients, and this sedation may reduce awareness, including awareness of pruritic symptoms.","Drowsiness, local burning, stinging, irritation, tingling, rash; systemic side-effects such as antimuscarinic effects, headache, fever, dizziness, gastro-intestinal disturbances has been reported."
Doxepin (Oral),Doxepin binds with high affinity to the histamine H1 receptor (Ki<1 nM) where it functions as an antagonist. The exact mechanism by which doxepin exerts its sleep maintenance effect is unknown but is believed due to its antagonism of the H1 receptor.,"The following serious adverse reactions are as follows:

Abnormal thinking and behavioral changes 
Suicide risk and worsening of depression
CNS Depressant effects"
Dorzolamide + Timolol,"Dorzolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, has actions similar to acetazolamide. By inhibiting carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye, dorzolamide decreases aqueous humor secretion. Used together, there is additional intraocular pressure reduction compared to using either component alone, but the reduction is not as much as concomitant admin of dorzolamide tid and timolol bid.Timolol maleate, a nonselective β-adrenergic blocker, reduces aqueous humor formation.","Mild burning, ocular hyperemia, blurred vision may occur."
Doripenem,"Doripenem is a synthetic broad-spectrum carbapenem β-lactam antibiotic with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against aerobic and anaerobic gm+ve and gm-ve bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to several penicillin-binding proteins, which in turn inhibits the final transpeptidase step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls.","Headache, nausea, diarrhoea, rash, pruritus, phlebitis, elevated hepatic enzymes, oral candidiasis, anaemia, vulvomycotic infection, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia."
Dopamine Hydrochloride,"Dopamine is a preparation of Dopamine hydrochloride which can stimulate α, β and dopamine receptors. It is a natural catecholamine formed by the decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). Dopamine is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system, especially in the nigrostriatal tract and in a few peripheral sympathetic nerves. It produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting an agonist action on β-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings. Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and so does not activate dopamine receptors in the brain.","The most frequent reported adverse reactions are ectopic beats, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, anginal pain, palpitations, dyspnoea, headache, hypotension, hypertension and vasoconstriction. Other less frequent adverse reactions are aberrant ventricular conduction, bradycardia, piloerection, mydriasis, widened QRS complex, azotaemia and elevated blood pressure. Peripheral ischemic gangrene in patients with pre-existing vascular disease. Fatal ventricular arrhythmias have been reported on rare occasions."
Eptifibatide,"Eptifibatide is a cyclic heptapeptide containing six amino acids and one mercaptopropionyl (des-amino cysteinyl) residue. Integril binds to the platelet receptor glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa of human platelets and reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive ligands to GP IIb/IIIa.","Bleeding is the most common adverse effect. Adverse reactions include intracranial hemorrhage & stroke, thrombocytopenia, allergic reactions and hypotension."
Epoetin Beta,"Epoetin beta is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anemic patients. Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates the formation of erythrocytes from its committed progenitors. It acts as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiation hormone. Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that, as a growth factor, primarily stimulates the formation of erythrocytes from its committed progenitors. It acts as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiation hormone.","Rarely (≥1/10,000 to ≤1/1,000), skin reactions such as rash, pruritus, urticaria or injection site reactions may occur. In very rare cases (≤1/10,000) anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. However, in controlled clinical studies no increased incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was found. In very rare cases (≤1/10,000), particularly when starting treatment, flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, headaches, pain in the limbs, malaise and/or bone pain have been reported. These reactions were mild or moderate in nature and subsided after a couple of hours or days."
Eplerenone,"Eplerenone selectively binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor and blocks the binding of aldosterone, a key component in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, which is involved in the regulation of BP and pathophysiology of CV disease. Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in both epithelial (e.g. kidney, GI tract) and nonepithelial (e.g. heart, blood vessels, brain) tissues; causing increases in BP by inducing Na reabsorption, vascular remodelling, water retention, endothelial dysfunction and possibly other mechanisms.","Headache, dizziness, diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea, cough or flu-like symptoms may occur. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction like: rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing can occur."
Epirubicin Hydrochloride,"Epirubicin, an anthracycline with cytotoxic properties. It inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis by steric obstruction after intercalating between DNA base pairs that triggers DNA cleavage by by topoisomerase II. It also inhibits DNA helicase and generates cytotoxic free radicals.","In early breast cancer, acute adverse events occurring in ≥10% of patients are leucopenia, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, amenhorrhea, lethargy, nausea/vomiting, mucositis, diarrhea, infection, conjunctivitis/keratitis, alopecia, local toxicity and rash/itch.Long term adverse events occurring at a frequency of 1-2% are asymptomatic drops in LVEF and CHF and secondary leukemia."
Epinastine Hydrochloride,"Epinastine is a topically active antihistamine that antagonizes both histamine H1 and H2 receptors. Moreover, it has mast cell stabilizing activity and prevents the release of inflammatory mediators from the blood vessel. Epinastine does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier and therefore is not expected to induce side effects on the central nervous system.","The most frequently reported side effects are mild burning sensation, folliculosis, hyperemia, pruritus, cold symptoms and upper respiratory infections."
Ephedrine Hydrochloride,"Ephedrine is a stimulant drug, belonging to a group of medicines known as sympathomimetics. Specifically it is both an alpha and beta adrenergic agonist. In addition, Ephedrine enhances the release of norepinephrine, a strong endogenous alpha agonist. The action of this compound is notably similar to that of the body's primary adrenergic hormone epinephrine (adrenaline), which also exhibits action toward both alpha and beta receptors. When administered, Ephedrine will notably increase the activity of the central nervous system, as well as have a stimulatory effect on other target cells.","Adverse effects reported are nausea, vomiting, anorexia; tachycardia (sometimes bradycardia), arrhythmias, anginal pain, vasoconstriction with hypertension, vasodilation with hypotension, dizziness and flushing; dyspnoea; headache, anxiety, restlessness, confusion, psychoses, insomnia, tremor; difficulty in micturition, urine retention; sweating, hypersalivation; changes in blood-glucose concentration; very rarely angle-closure glaucoma."
Eperisone Hydrochloride,Eperisone is centrally-acting skeletal muscle relaxant used to improve myotonic symptoms.,"The side effects of Eperisone are very rare, only a few cases have been observed. These are excessive relaxation, stomachache, nausea, vertigo, anorexia, drowsiness, skin rashes, diarrhea, vomiting, indigestion, GI disturbances, insomnia, headache, constipation, etc."
Epalrestat,"Epalrestat is aldose reductase inhibitor. The aldose reductase inhibitors have a distinct mechanism of action, affecting the underlying disease process in diabetic neuropathy, although the extent of the polyol pathway involvement is yet to be determined. This medicine suppresses accumulation of sorbitol in cells by inhibiting action of aldose reductase which converts glucose of sugar to sorbitol. Epalrestat may improve motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity and subjective neuropathy symptoms.","The most commonly reported adverse reactions include abdominal pain, nausea, rash, itch, erythema and blister."
Entecavir,"By competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate, entecavir functionally inhibits all three activities of the HBV polymerase (reverse transcriptase, rt):

Base priming,
Reverse transcription of the negative strand from the pregenomic messenger RNA, and
Synthesis of the positive strand of HBV DNA. Upon activation by kinases, the drug can be incorporated into the DNA which has the ultimate effect of inhibiting the HBV polymerase activity.","The most common adverse events are headache, fatigue, dizziness and nausea."
Entacapone,"Entacapone decreases the metabolic loss of levodopa to 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) through inhibition of COMT enzyme leading to an increased levodopa concentration, thus, extending the duration and effect in the brain.","Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, colitis, dry mouth, dyskinesia, dizziness, nightmares, insomnia, hallucinations, confusion, fatigue, increased sweating, behavioural disturbances; urine, skin, hair, beard and nail discolourations; cholestatic hepatitis, rhabdomyolysis. Rarely, agitation, urticaria, erythematous or maculopapular rash, anorexia, wt decrease, increased liver enzymes."
Enoxaparin Sodium,"Enoxaparin Sodium is a low molecular weight heparin with a high anti-Xa activity and low anti-lla or antithrombin activity. At doses required for the various indications, Enoxaparin Sodium does not increase bleeding time. At preventive doses, Enoxaparin Sodium causes no notable modification of activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT). It neither influences platelet aggregation nor binding of fibrinogen to platelets. Enoxaparin Sodium is primarily metabolised in the liver.","Haemorrhage (bleeding), Thrombocytopenia, elevations of serum aminotransferase. Pain, bluish marks at injection sites to skin rash at injection sites. Cases of neuraxial hematomas with the concurrent use of Enoxaparin and spinal/epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture have resulted in varying degrees of neurologic injuries."
Encephalitis Vaccine,The mechanism of action of Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccines is not well understood. Studies in animals have shown that the vaccine triggers the immune system to produce antibodies against Japanese encephalitis virus that are most often protective. Challenge studies were performed in mice that were treated with human Encephalitis Vaccine antisera. These studies showed that almost all mice that had a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test titre of at least 1:10 were protected from a lethal Japanese encephalitis virus challenge.,"Very common: headache, muscle pain, injection site pain, injection site tenderness, tiredness.Common: Nausea, influenza like illness, fever, other injection site reactions (e.g. redness, hardening, swelling, itching).Uncommon: vomiting, skin rash, changes in the lymph-nodes, migraine (throbbing headache, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting and sensitivity to light), dizziness, vertigo (spinning sensation), diarrhoea, belly pain, excessive sweating, itching, chills, general condition of feeling unwell, musculoskeletal stiffness, joint pain, weakness, abnormal laboratory liver test results (hepatic enzymes increased)."
Enalapril Maleate,"Enalapril, after hydrolysis to enalaprilate, inhibits Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of enalapril in hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system","Dizziness and headache are more commonly reported side effects. Fatigue and asthenia were reported in 2-3% of patients. Other side effects occurred in less than 2% of patients and included hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, nausea, diarrhoea, muscle cramps, rash and cough.Less frequently renal dysfunction, renal failure and oliguria have been reported. Angioedema, hyperkalemia and hyponatremia have also been reported rarely"
Empagliflozin + Metformin Hydrochloride,"Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2 (SGLT2). SGLT2 is the predominant transporter, responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the kidney back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, Empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug, used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. It does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.","Most common adverse reactions associated with Empagliflozin (5% or greater incidence) were urinary tract infection and female genital mycotic infections. Most common adverse reactions associated with Metformin (>5%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache. The following important adverse reactions are given below:

Very common: Hypoglycemia (when used with sulphonylurea or insulin), Gastrointestinal symptoms
Common: Vaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infection. Urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis and urosepsis), thirst, taste disturbance, pruritus (generalised), rash, Increased urination, serum lipids increased
Uncommon: Volume depletion, urticaria, dysuria, blood creatinine increased/Glomerular filtration rate decreased, Haematocrit increased
Rare: Diabetic ketoacidosis."
Empagliflozin + Linagliptin,"Empagliflozin: Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is the predominant transporter responsible for the reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion.
 
Linagliptin: Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4, an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Thus, linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the levels of glucagon in the circulation. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretin hormones are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore, GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output.","The most common side effects are:

urinary tract infection
stuffy or runny nose and sore throat
upper respiratory tract infection"
Empagliflozin,"Empagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor. SGLT2 co-transporters are responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate in the kidney. The glucuretic effect resulting from SGLT2 inhibition reduces renal absorption and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, resulting in increased glucose excretion. Additionally, it contributes to reduced hyperglycaemia, assists weight loss, and reduces blood pressure.","The most common adverse reactions associated with Empagliflozin are urinary tract infections and female genital mycotic infections. Others common side effects includes dehydration, hypotension, weakness, dizziness and increased thirstiness."
Emollient [Cepalin+Allantoin],"It softens and hydrates skin. It is also a mild cleanser for dry, sensitive skin. It helps reduce dryness and leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.",Skin irritation in people hypersensitive to any of the ingredients.
Eluxadoline,"Eluxadoline is a mu-opioid receptor agonist, kappa opioid receptor agonist & delta opioid receptor antagonist. Eluxadoline works directly in intestine to reduce peristalsis, also makes the nerves in intestine less sensitive to stimulation.","Most common adverse reactions are constipation, nausea andabdominal pain."
Eltrombopag Olamine,"Eltrombopag is an orally bioavailable, small-molecule TPO-receptor agonist that interacts with the transmembrane domain of the human TPO-receptor. Eltrombopag is a stimulator of STAT and JAK phosphorylation. Unlike recombinant TPO or romiplostim, Eltrombopag does not activate the AKT pathway in any way. It should be noted that when given to patients with aplastic anemia, other lineages besides platelet count were increased, suggesting that either eltrombopag enhanced the effect of TPO in vivo; or there is a yet uncovered mechanism of action at work.","The most common side effects of Eltrombopag in adults when used to treat chronic ITP are: In adult patients with ITP, the most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 5% and greater than placebo) were: nausea, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, increased ALT, myalgia and urinary tract infection. In pediatric patients age 1 year and older with ITP, the most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 10% and greater than placebo) were upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis.In patients with chronic hepatitis C-associated thrombocytopenia, the most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 10% and greater than placebo) were: anemia, pyrexia, fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, influenza-like illness, asthenia, insomnia, cough, pruritus, chills, myalgia, alopecia and peripheral edema. In patients with severe aplastic anemia, the most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 20%) were: nausea, fatigue, cough, diarrhea and headache."
Elagolix,"Endometriosis develops when tissue that is similar to the kind that is normally located in the uterus starts to grow outside of the uterus. Such growth leads to various symptoms like pain during periods, pelvic pain between periods, and pain during sexual intercourse. The growths themselves are referred to as lesions and frequently develop on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and other areas around the uterus, including the bowel or bladder. The growth of these lesions is dependent upon the estrogen hormone.Elagolix is an orally-administered, nonpeptide small molecule gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist that inhibits endogenous GnRH signaling by binding competitively to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland Label. Administration of elagolix results in dose-dependent suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to decreased blood concentrations of the ovarian sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone.","Most common adverse reactions (>5%) in clinical trials included hot flushes and night sweats, headache, nausea, insomnia, amenorrhea, anxiety, arthralgia, depression-related adverse reactions and mood changes."
Estriol (Oral),"Estriol induces the normalization of the vaginal epithelium and thus helps to restore the normal microflora and the physiological pH in the vagina. As a result, it increases the resistance of the vaginal epithelial cells to infection and inflammation. In comparison to other estrogens, estriol is short acting. In the years just before and after the menopause (which can be natural or surgically induced) estriol can be used in the treatment of symptoms and complaints related to estrogen deficiency. Estriol is particularly used in the treatment of urogenital symptoms.After oral administration, estriol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma levels of unconjugated estriol are reached within 1 hr of administration. Nearly all (90%) estriol is bound to albumin in the plasma and unlike other estrogens; estriol is hardly bound to sex hormone-binding globulin. The metabolism of estriol consists mainly of conjugation and deconjugation during enterohepatic circulation. Estriol, a metabolic end product, is mainly excreted via the urine in the conjugated form. Only a small fraction is excreted via the feces, mainly as unconjugated estriol.","Breast tension or pain, nausea, spotting, fluid retention and cervical hypersecretion may occasionally occur and be indicative of too high dosage. Headache, hypertension, leg cramps and vision disturbances are seldom observed. In general, most of these adverse reactions disappear after the 1 st week of treatment.Breast enlargement, vaginal candidiasis, change in vaginal bleeding pattern, vomiting, stomach cramps, cholestatic jaundice, chloasma or melasma, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, hemorrhagic eruption, mental depression, chorea, increasing or decreasing body weight, edema, changes in libido."
Esomeprazole + Amoxicillin + Clarithromycin,"Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole's duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hoursAmoxicillin is similar to penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria.Clarithromycin acts by inhibiting microsomal protein synthesis in susceptible organisms mainly by binding to the donor site on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and preventing translocation to that site.",H. pylori eradication therapy is generally well tolerated. Adverse events reported during clinical trials were not unexpected given the component substances. Common adverse reactions included diarrhoea and nausea.
Esomeprazole (MUPS tablet),"Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+ ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.","The most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esomeprazole include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment."
Esmolol Hydrochloride,"Esmolol Hydrochloride is a beta-1 selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent with rapid onset, a very short duration of action, and no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutic dosages. Its elimination half-life after intravenous infusion is approximately 9 minutes. Esmolol Hydrochloride inhibits the beta 1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle, but this preferential effect is not absolute and at higher doses it begins to inhibit beta 2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature.","Most common adverse reactions (incidence> 10%) are symptomatic hypotension (hyperhidrosis, dizziness) and asymptomatic hypotension."
Esomeprazole,"Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals. Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1–1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces. Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.","The most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esomeprazole include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment."
Eslicarbazepine Acetate,"Eslicarbazepine acetate is converted into the anti-epileptic medicine Eslicarbazepine in the body. Epilepsy is caused by excessive electrical activity in the brain. For electrical impulses to travel along nerves there needs to be a rapid movement of sodium into the nerve cells. Eslicarbazepine acetate is thought to work by blocking ‘voltage-gated sodium channels’, which stops sodium entering the nerve cells. This reduces the activity of the nerve cells in the brain, reducing the intensity and the number of seizures.","The use of Eslicarbazepine acetate is associated with increase in the PR interval. Adverse reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. AV block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur."
Escitalopram Oxalate,"Escitalopram is an orally administered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic bicyclic phthalate derivative citalopram. Escitalopram is at least 100 fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic Dopamine, Histamine, Muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.","SSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. Side-effects of the SSRIs include gastrointestinal effects (dose-related and fairly common include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss (increased appetite and weight gain also reported) and hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia, and photosensitivity; other side-effects include dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, headache, insomnia, tremor, dizziness, asthenia, hallucinations, drowsiness, convulsions, galactorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, sweating, hypomania or mania, movement disorders and dyskinesias, visual disturbances."
Erythromycin (Lotion),"Erythromycin is a bacteriostatic macrolide antibiotic. But may be bactericidal in high concentrations. Although the mechanism by which Erythromycin acts in reducing the inflammatory lesions of acne vulgaris is unknown, it is presumably due to the antibiotic action of the drug.","Erythema, desquamation, burning sensation, eye irritation, tenderness, dryness, oily skin etc."
Erythromycin (Oral),"Erythromycin inhibits microsomal protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by inhibiting the translocation process. Specific binding to the 50S subunit or 70S ribosome occurs in these organisms but there is no binding to the stable 80S mammalian ribosome. Erythromycin is active against many Grampositive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria and against mycoplasmas and chlamydia.Absorption: Erythromycin base is destroyed by acid and is therefore administered in the form of stable ester. The rates of absorption of the base and esters are diminished by the presence of food. The stearate is hydrolyzed in the intestine and the free erythromycin absorbed. Blood concentration: After an oral dose of 500 mg. of the base of stearate, peak serum concentrations of 0.9 to 1.4 or 0.4 to 1.8 mg/ml. respectively are attained in 1 to 4 hours. Half-life: The serum half-life is 1.2 to 4 hours. In subjects with oliguria, the half-life is about 5 hours.Distribution: Erythromycin is widely distributed throughout body tissue and fluids with some retention in the liver and spleen, protein binding of erythromycin base is 73%. Erythromycin enters the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges are inflamed. It also crosses the placenta and is excreted in the milk.Excretion: 5 to 15 % of the dose of erythromycin is excreted in the urine and large amounts of the unchanged active substance are excreted in the bile.","Allergic reactions are rare and mild although anaphylaxis has occurred. Occasionally there is abdominal discomfort after oral administration, sometimes with nausea and vomiting. This discomfort usually subsides after a few days without it being necessary to reduce the dosage."
Ertugliflozin,"SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. Ertugliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, ertugliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.","The following important adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

Ketoacidosis 
Lower Limb Amputation 
Volume Depletion
Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis
Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues
Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier’s Gangrene)
Genital Mycotic Infections"
Ertapenem,"The bactericidal activity of ertapenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through ertapenem binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). In Escherichia coli, it has strong affinity toward PBPs 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4 and 5 with preference for PBPs 2 and 3. Ertapenem is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases. Ertapenem is hydrolyzed by metallo-beta-lactamases.","Adults: The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in patients treated with Ertapenem, including those who were switched to therapy with an oral antimicrobial, were diarrhea, nausea, headache and infused vein complication. In the prophylaxis indication, the overall adverse experience profile was generally comparable to that observed for ertapenem in other clinical trials.Pediatrics: Adverse reactions in this population were comparable to adults. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in pediatric patients treated with Ertapenem, including those who were switched to therapy with an oral antimicrobial, were diarrhea, vomiting and infusion site pain."
Eribulin Mesylate,"Eribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the shortening phase and sequesters tubulin into nonproductive aggregates. Eribulin exerts its effects via a tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism leading to G2/M cell-cycle block, disruption of mitotic spindles, and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic blockage.","The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥25%) were neutropenia, anemia, asthenia/fatigue, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and constipation."
Ergotamine Tartrate + Caffeine,"Ergotamine is an α-adrenergic blocker with a direct stimulating effect on the smooth muscle of peripheral and cranial blood vessels, it also depresses central vasomotor centers. Caffeine is also a cranial vasoconstrictor.","Increased BP, hypotension, rapid and weak pulse, palpitations, arrhythmias, precordial pain, coronary infarction, fibrotic thickening of the heart valves. Cerebral ischaemia and thrombosis, blurred vision, sleep disturbances, urinary retention, muscle cramps and joint pains. GI symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain. Dysaesthesia, paraesthesia, formication, tremor, convulsions, headache, extrapyramidal effects. Anxiety, depression, confusion, hallucinations, psychomotor impairment."
Ergometrine Maleate,"Ergometrine causes contraction of the uterine muscle. At low doses, there is an increase in frequency and amplitude of contractions while at higher doses, the basal tone of the uterus is increased. Ergometrine also causes vasoconstriction of peripheral and cerebral vessels.","Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea; headache, dizziness; tinnitus; chest pain, palpitation, bradycardia, transient hypertension and other cardiac arrhythmias; dyspnoea, sometimes rashes, shock"
Erdosteine,"Erdosteine is a prodrug that is metabolised into N-thiodiglycolyl-homocysteine whereby free thiol groups are formed leading to the opening of the disulphide bonds of the bronchial mucoproteins, thus reducing the viscosity of mucus and purulent sputum. It also antagonises the local formation of free radicals and inhibits elastase enzyme activity and bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells.","Common side effect is epigastric pain. Other side effects include headache, cold, taste alterations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, angioedema and other skin allergic reactions."
Etodolac,"Similar to other NSAIDs, the anti-inflammatory effects of etodolac result from inhibition of the enzyme cycooxygenase (COX). This decreases the synthesis of peripheral prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation. Etodolac binds to the upper portion of the COX enzyme active site and prevents its substrate, arachidonic acid, from entering the active site. Etodolac was previously thought to be a non-selective COX inhibitor, but it is now known to be 5-50 times more selective for COX-2 than COX-1. Antipyresis may occur by central action on the hypothalamus, resulting in peripheral dilation, increased cutaneous blood flow, and subsequent heat loss.","The common side effects of Etodolac involve the gastrointestinal system. It can cause abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, heartburn, nausea, Gl ulcers, vomiting. Other events including abnormal renal function, anemia, dizziness, edema, elevated liver enzymes, headaches, increased bleeding time, pruritis, rashes, tinnitus etc."
Ethosuximide,"Ethosuximide suppresses the paroxysmal three cycle per second spike and wave activity associated with lapses of consciousness which is common in absence (petit mal) seizures. The frequency of epileptiform attacks is reduced, apparently by depression of the motor cortex and elevation of the threshold of the central nervous system to convulsive stimuli.","Blood toxicities and disorders; headache, fatigue, lethargy, drowsiness, dizziness, ataxia, hiccup and mild euphoria; more rarely, psychotic states, rashes, hepatic and renal changes, and haematological disorders. SLE, erythema multiforme. Gum hypertrophy, swelling of tongue, irritability, hyperactivity, sleep disturbances, night terrors, inability to concentrate, aggressiveness, increased libido, myopia, vag bleeding."
Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel + Ferrous Fumarate,"This pill is an effective, temporary and short term birth control management for women. This tablet contains two hormones, Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol. Every single strip contains 28 tablets from which 21 tablets contains hormone and 7 tablets contains Iron. Combination oral contraceptives lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation. Other possible mechanism may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation.","Common: Headache, nausea, mood changes including depression, vaginal infections, irregular vaginal bleeding, pain and discomfort. Rare: liver tumors, jaundice, high blood pressure & gallbladder problem."
Ethinyl Estradiol + Gestodene,"This contains two active ingredients, Gestodene and Ethinylestradiol. Ethinylestradiol is a synthetic version of oestrogen and Gestodene is a synthetic form of progesterone. If this tablet is taken according to instructions the egg cells (normally released by the ovary each month) are prevented from maturing to the point where they can be fertilized. Secondary mechanisms, which may contribute to the effectiveness of Gestop 28 as a contraceptive, include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm penetration) and changes in the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).","At the initial stage some women may experience side-effects like dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight gain, fluid retension, depression, mood changes, breast pain, breast tenderness, rash, vaginal discharge, erythema etc. If taken regularly, such types of side-effects normally lessen with time. If she continues to have the side effects beyond 2-3 months, she could consult with a doctor."
Ethinyl Estradiol + Drospirenone (HRT),"173-estradiol, which is chemically and biologically identical to endogenous human E2, and the synthetic progestogen, DRSP. 173-estradiol provides hormone replacement during and after the climacteric. The addition of DRSP helps to provide bleeding control and opposes the development of endometrial hyperplasia caused by estrogens.Effects of estradiol: The loss of the ovarian function, accompanied by a depletion of estrogen and progesterone production, leads to the menopausal syndrome, characterized by vasomotor and organic symptoms. Hormone replacement therapy is indicated to eliminate these complaints. Of all physiological estrogens, E2 is the most potent one with the highest affinity to the estrogen receptor. Estrogen target organs include, in particular, uterus, hypothalamus, pituitary, vagina, breast, bones (osteoclasts).Other effects of estrogens include reduction of insulin and blood glucose concentrations local vasoactive effects mediated by receptors, and receptor-independent effects on vascular smooth muscle. Estrogen receptors have been identified in the heart and coronary arteries. Oral administration of natural estrogens is advantageous in certain cases of hypercholesterolemia in order to maximize beneficial metabolic liver effects on lipids.","The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with Ethinylestradiol & Drospirenone are breast pain, female genital tract bleeding and gastrointestinal and abdominal pains. They occur in >6% of users. Bleeding irregularities usually subside during continued treatment. The frequency of bleeding decreases with the duration of treatment. Serious adverse reactions are arterial and venous thromboembolic events as well as breast cancer"
Ethinyl Estradiol + Drospirenone (24 tablet),"This contains two active ingredients- Ethinylestradiol and Drospirenone. Ethinylestradiol is a synthetic version of estrogen and Drospirenone is a synthetic form of progesterone. The hormonal components of this preparation inhibit ovulation by suppressing gonadotropin release. Secondary mechanisms, which may contribute to the effectiveness of this tablet as a contraceptive, include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm penetration) and changes in the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).Drospirenone has antimineralocorticoid activity, counteracting estrogen-related sodium retention. In combination with Ethinyloestradiol, Drospirenone displays a favorable lipid profile with an increase in high-density lipoprotein HDL. Drospirenone exerts antiandrogenic activity and does not counteract the ethinyloestradiol-related sex hormone-binding globulin increase which is useful for binding and inactivating the endogenous androgens.","Different types of tablet suit to different types of woman. At the initial stage some women may experience side-effects like dizziness, headache, breast pain, nausea or unscheduled uterine bleeding. These symptoms may occur in >3% of users. After starting one brand of oral contraceptive tablets, if you feel any inconvenience such as migraine, changes in eyesight or speech, unusual pain or swelling in your legs, sharp chest pains or shortness of breath, rash, yellow skin or a rise in blood pressure take immediate advice from your doctor."
Ethinyl Estradiol + Drospirenone (21 tablet),"This is a combined oral contraceptive tablet containing the synthetic progestogen, drospirenone and the synthetic estrogen, ethinylestradiol. The contraceptive effect of this tablet is based on the interaction of various factors, the most important of which are seen as the inhibition of ovulation and the changes in cervical secretion. When this tablet is taken according to instructions, the egg cells are prevented from maturing to the point at which they can be fertilized, the cervical mucus remains thick so as to constitute a barrier to sperm and the endometrium is rendered unreceptive to implantation. As well as protection against pregnancy, estrogen/progestogen combinations have several positive properties which, next to the negative properties, can be useful in deciding on the method of birth control. The cycle is more regular and the menstruation is often less painful and bleeding is lighter.Drospirenone has antimineralocorticoid activity, counteracting estrogen related sodium retention. In combination with ethinylestradiol, drospirenone displays a favourable lipid profile with an increase in high-density lipoprotein HDL. Drospirenone exerts antiandrogenic activity and does not counteract the ethinylestradiol-related sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) increase which is useful for binding and inactivating the endogenous androgens. Drospirenone is devoid of any androgenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid and antiglucocorticoid activity. This in combination with the antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic properties, gives drospirenone a biochemical and pharmacological profile closely resembling the natural hormone progesterone.","Like other contraceptives some undesirable effects may have seen with this tablet, these include venous and arterial thromboembolic disorders. The following undesirable effects have been reported in users of COCs and whether this association is causal has not been confirmed: Nausea, abdominal pain, Vomiting, diarrhoea, Weight increased, Fluid retention, Headache, Migraine, Depressed mood, mood altered, Breast pain, breast tenderness, Libido decreased, Breast hypertrophy, Rash, urticaria. In women with hereditary angioedema exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema."
Ethambutol,"Ethambutol appears to inhibit the synthesis of 1 or more metabolites in susceptible bacteria resulting in impairment of cellular metabolism, arrest of multiplication, and cell death. It is active against susceptible bacteria only when they are undergoing cell division.","Retrobulbar neuritis with reduction in visual acuity, constriction of visual field, central or peripheral scotoma and green-red colour blindness of 1 or both eyes. Reduced renal clearance of urate and may precipitate acute gout. Confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, headache, dizziness, malaise, jaundice or transient liver dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary infiltrates, eosinophilia and GI disturbances (e.g. nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain). Rarely, retinal haemorrhage, hypersensitivity reactions including rashes, pruritus, leucopenia, fever, and joint pains."
Etanercept,"Etanercept is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker. This is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the human 75 kilodalton (p75) tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. The Fc component of etanercept contains the CH2 domain, the CH3 domain and hinge region, but not the CH1 domain of IgG1. Etanercept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian cell expression system. It consists of 934 amino acids and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons. Etanercept is a TNF alpha inhibitor that binds specifically to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and blocks its interaction with cell surface TNF receptors. TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated levels of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of RA patients. It plays an important role in the inflammatory processes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and the resulting joint pathology.","Very common: Infections (including colds, sinusitis, bronchitis, urinary tract infections and skin infections); injection site reactions (including bleeding, bruising, redness, itching, pain, and swelling). Reactions at the injection site (these do not occur as often after the first month of treatment. Some patients have developed a reaction at an injection site that was used before.Common: Allergic reactions; fever; itching; antibodies directed against normal tissue (autoantibody formation).Uncommon: Serious infections (including pneumonia, deep skin infections, joint infections, blood infection, and infections at various sites); low blood platelet count; skin cancer (excluding melanoma); localized swelling of the skin (angio edema); hives (elevated patches of red or pale skin that often itch); eye inflammation; psoriasis (new or worsening); rash; inflammation or scarring of the lungs; inflammation of the blood vessels affecting multiple organs."
Eszopiclone,Eszopiclone may interact with Gama-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complexes at binding domains located close to or allosterically coupled to benzodiazepine receptors.,"Eszopiclone is generally well tolerated. However few side effects like fatigue, anorexia, nausea, unpleasant taste in the mouth, mood problems, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, asthenia, nervousness, dizziness and confusion have been reported."
Estriol (Vaginal),"Estriol Cream is a Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). It contains the female hormone estriol (an estrogen). During menopause Estriol is used in vagina which is slowly released and absorbed into the surrounding area and into the bloodstream.Estriol induces the normalization of the vaginal epithelium and thus helps to restore the normal microflora and the physiological pH in the vagina. As a result, it increases the resistance of the vaginal epithelial cells to infection and inflammation. In comparison to other estrogens, estriol is short acting. In the years just before and after the menopause (which can be natural or surgically induced) estriol can be used in the treatment of symptoms and complaints related to estrogen deficiency. Estriol is particularly used in the treatment of urogenital symptoms.","Local irritation or itching of vagina, Swelling and increased tenderness of the breasts, Increased vaginal discharge, Nausea, Fluid retention in the tissues, usually marked by swollen ankles or feet.
In most patients these side effects will disappear after the first weeks of treatment. Tell your doctor if vaginal bleeding occurs or if any side effect becomes troublesome or persists.
Other side effects which may occur with HRT are benign and malignant hormone-dependent tumors such as endometrial cancer, heart attack and stroke, gall bladder disease, skin problems such as rashes, discoloration or red patches on the skin, various skin diseases with blisters and nodules or bleeding into the skin, venous thromboembolism or deep leg or pelvic venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (see Before you use Estriol Cream). Using HRT for several years slightly increases the risk of breast cancer."
Ferrous Ascorbate + Folic Acid + Zinc Sulfate,"Ferrous Ascorbate, Folic Acid & Zinc is a combination of three nutritional supplements. Ferrous Ascorbate is a combination of iron and vitamin C. Iron replenishes the iron stores in your body and corrects iron deficiency anemia. Vitamin C (ascorbate) is added to enhance the absorption of iron in the body. Folic Acid is a form of vitamin B. It plays a vital role in the formation of red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body. It is also essential in pregnancy due to its role in the development of the unborn baby's brain and spinal cord. Zinc is a micromineral that provides nutrition.","Side effects of iron, folic acid and zinc supplementation are mild and transient. These include epigastric pain, nausea, constipation, vomiting, diarrhoea, heart burn, etc. Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid."
Ferrous Ascorbate,"Ferrous ascorbate, a synthetic molecule of ascorbic acid and iron. Iron replenishes the iron stores in your body and corrects iron deficiency anemia. Vitamin C (ascorbate) is added to enhance the absorption of iron in the body.","The treatment of a neurotic patient was interrupted because of nausea and regurgitation. In pregnant women, the incidence of pyrosis and chronic constipation is slightly increased."
Ferric Derisomaltose,"This is an iron replacement product containing ferric derisomaltose for intravenous infusion. Ferric derisomaltose is an iron carbohydrate complex with a matrix structure composed of interchanging layers of ferric hydroxide and the carbohydrate derisomaltose. Derisomaltose consists of linear, hydrogenated isomaltooligosaccharides with an average molecular weight of 1000 Da and a narrow molecular weight distribution that is almost devoid of mono- and disaccharides. Ferric derisomaltose is a complex of iron (III) hydroxide and derisomaltose, an iron carbohydrate oligosaccharide that releases iron. Iron binds to transferrin for transport to erythroid precursor cells to be incorporated into hemoglobin.",Most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥1%) are rash and nausea.
Ferric Citrate,"Hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease on dialysis: Ferric iron binds dietary phosphate in the GI tract and precipitates as ferric phosphate. This compound is insoluble and is excreted in the stool. By binding phosphate in the GI tract and decreasing absorption, ferric citrate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum.Iron deficiency anemia in chronic kidney disease not on dialysis: Ferric iron is reduced from the ferric to the ferrous form by ferric reductase in the GI tract. After transport through the enterocytes into the blood, oxidized ferric iron circulates bound to the plasma protein transferrin, and can be incorporated into hemoglobin.","Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%) are discolored feces, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, cough, abdominal pain, and hyperkalemia."
Ferric Carboxymaltose,"Non-dextran, IV is a colloidal iron hydroxide in complex with carboxymaltose, a carbohydrate polymer that releases iron; replaces iron stores found in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and enzymes; works to transport oxygen via hemoglobin Macrophage engulf FCM from blood and control iron release. Transferrin saturates and, Iron into the liver, spleen and Bone marrow.","Nausea, Hypertension, Flushing, Decreased blood phosphorus, Dizziness, Vomiting, Pruritus, Rash, Urticaria, Wheezing, Injection site discoloration, Headache, Increased alanine aminotransferase), Dysgeusia, Hypotension, Constipation, Serious anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions"
Fenticonazole Nitrate [Vaginal Tablet],"Fenticonazole is a potent broad-spectrum antimycotic agent. It exerts fungistatic and fungicidal actions on dermatophytes, pathogenic yeasts, dimorphous fungi and molds. In addition, Fenticonazole is active against gram-positive bacteria and is therefore indicated in mycoses associated with bacterial super infections. Fenticonazole is also active, both in vitro and in vivo, against Trichomonas vaginalis. Fenticonazole exerts its unique antimycotic action through following three ways:

Inhibiting the biosynthesis of ergosterol leading to the damage of fungal cell membrane.
Causing certain changes in oxidative and peroxidative enzyme activities inside fungal cell. This leads to an intracellular build-up of toxic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide resulting in cell necrosis.
Inhibiting the secretion of aspartic proteases (responsible for pathogenicity) by Candida albicans.

The amount of Fenticonazole absorbed by the transcutaneous route is negligible.","After intravaginal administration slight transient burning (which usually disappears rapidly) may occasionally happen. Prolonged topical application may cause sensitisation reactions. Fenticonazole is generally well tolerated by the mucous membranes; only exceptionally mild and transient erythematous reactions have been reported. After topical application or intravaginal administration, a slight burning sensation may occur, usually subsiding soon. Should more persistent irritation occur or resistant micro-organism develop, suspend the treatment and seek the doctor's advice. Due to poor absorption of Fenticonazole, no systemic effects should occur, provided the above instructions are carefully observed."
Fenticonazole Nitrate [Vaginal Cream],"Fenticonazole is a broad-spectrum antimycotic agent with activity against dermatophytes and yeasts. Fenticonazole has also been shown to exhibit antibacterial action, with a spectrum of activity that includes bacteria commonly associated with vaginal infections and antiparasitic action against the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. Therefore, Fenticonazole may be an ideal topical alternative to multi-agent treatment of mixed infections involving mycotic, bacterial, dermatophyte and/or Trichomonas spp.","After intravaginal administration, slight transient burning may occasionally occur, which usually disappears rapidly."
Fentanyl Citrate,"Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic. Fentanyl interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor but also binds to kappa and delta-type opioid receptors. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, Fentanyl exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Fentanyl may increase the patient's tolerance for pain and decrease the perception of suffering, although the presence of the pain itself may still be recognized. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Fentanyl depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils.","As with other narcotic analgesics, the most common serious adverse reactions reported to occur with Fentanyl are respiratory depression, apnoea, muscular rigidity, myoclonic movements, and bradycardia. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur with intravenous administration if a dose is given too rapidly and it rarely occurs with intramuscular administration."
Fenofibrate,"Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative. Fenofibrate is rapidly hydrolyzed after oral ingestion to its pharmacologically active form, fenofibric acid. Fenofibric acid produces reductions in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, Apo-lipoprotein B, Total triglycerides and VLDL. In addition, treatment with Fenofibrate results in increases in HDL and apo-proteins apoAI apoAII. Fenofibrate also reduces serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemic and normal individuals by increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid. The micronised form of Nofiate (Fenofibrate) has enhanced absorption over the non-micronised formulation.","Gastro-intestinal (e.g. nausea, anorexia, gastric pain), pruritus, urticaria, impotence, also headache, dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, hair loss; myotoxicity."
Febuxostat,"Febuxostat is a non-purine, selective xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor. It decreases serum uric acid level by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for uric acid production. Xanthine oxidase breaks down hypoxanthine to xanthine and thus to uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations.","The most common adverse events associated with the use of Febuxostat may include liver function abnormalities, nausea, arthralgia, and rash."
Favipiravir,"Favipiravir is a new antiviral drug against influenza. It is metabolized into favipiravir ribosyl triphosphate (favipiravir RTP) by an intracellular enzyme, and favipiravir RTP selectively inhibits RNA polymerase (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) of the influenza virus, preventing replication of the influenza virus. It is a drug with a mechanism of action different from that of the existing influenza antiviral drugs and effective against all types and sub-types of human influenza A, B, and C viruses in vitro, showing a wide range of anti-viral activity against various influenza virus strains including avian and swine viruses.",Most common side effects are Diarrhea and increase of blood uric acid levels.
Famotidine,"Famotidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist. Famotidine completely inhibits the action of histamine on H2- receptors of parietal cell. It inhibits basal, overnight and pentagastrin stimulated gastric acid secretion. The H2- receptor antagonist activity of Famotidine is slowly reversible, since the drug dissociates slowly from H2-receptor.","Eruption, constipation, diarrhoea, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, high blood pressure, headache, drowsiness or insomnia may rarely occur."
Famciclovir,"Famciclovir rapidly undergoes biotransformation to penciclovir, which has inhibitory activity against HSV types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Thymidine kinase then phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form, which is then converted to penciclovir triphosphate. This inhibits HSV-2 DNA polymerase by competing with deoxyguanosine triphosphate, thus inhibiting herpes viral DNA synthesis and replication.","Headache, nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue, dizziness, fever, paraesthesia, somnolence, vomiting, constipation, anorexia, abdominal pain, flatulence, dyspepsia; increased serum levels of ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and albumin; pruritus, pharyngitis, sinusitis, injury, generalised pain, rigors, back pain, arthralgia; increased serum phosphate, Na and K levels; abnormal leukocyte counts, purpura, angioedema."
Ezetimibe,"Ezetimibe localises at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits absorption of cholesterol via the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like1 (NPC1L1). This results in decreased delivery of cholesterol to the liver, reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and increased clearance of cholesterol from the blood.","Clinical studies of Ezetimibe (administered alone or with an HMG-CoA reductaseinhibitor) demonstrated that Ezetimibe was generally well tolerated. The overallincidence of adverse events reported with Ezetimibe was similar to that reported withplacebo, and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events was also similar for Ezetimibeand placebo."
Everolimus,"Everolimus, a proliferation signal inhibitor, prevents allograft rejection in rodent and nonhuman primate models of allotransplantation. It exerts its immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting the proliferation and thus, clonal expansion, of antigen-activated T cells which is driven by T cell-specific interleukins eg, interleukin-2 and interleukin-15. Everolimus inhibits an intracellular signaling pathway that normally leads to cell proliferation when triggered by the binding of these T cell growth factors to their receptors. The blockage of this signal by everolimus causes cells to be arrested at the G1 stage of the cell cycle.At the molecular level, everolimus forms a complex with the cytoplasmic protein FKBP-12. In the presence of everolimus, the growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase is inhibited. Since p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation is under the control of FRAP (also called m-TOR), this finding suggests that the everolimus-FKBP-12 complex binds to and thus, interferes with the function of FRAP. FRAP is a key regulatory protein which governs cell metabolism, growth and proliferation; disabling FRAP function thus explains the cell cycle arrest caused by everolimus.","Stomatitis, Constipation, Infections, Asthenia, Fatigue, Cough, Diarrhea, Rash, Anemia, Nausea, Anorexia, Edema, peripheral, Dyspnea, Pyrexia, Vomiting, Headache, Epistaxis, Decreased lymphocytes, Grade 3, Increased glucose, Grade 3, Pneumonitis, Pruritus, Dry skin, Decreased Hgb, Grade 3, Menstrual irregularities, Dysgeusia, Hypertension, Hemorrhage, Tachycardia, CHF"
Eucalyptol + Menthol + Methyl Salicylate + Thymol + Sodium Fluoride,"Eucalyptol is a natural organic compound which is a colorless liquid. It is a cyclic ether and a monoterpenoid. Eucalyptol is an ingredient in many brands of mouthwash and cough suppressant. It controls airway mucus hypersecretion and asthma via anti-inflammatory cytokine inhibition.Menthol: It provides cooling sensation by stimulation of cooling receptor and gives local anesthetic actionMethyl Salicylate: It penetrates and reaches at high concentration in pain regions and inhibit the prostaglandin synthesis and relieves pain effectivelyThymol, one of the chemicals in thyme, is used with another chemical, chlorhexidine, as a dental varnish to prevent tooth decay. In foods, thyme is used as a flavoring agent. In manufacturing, red thyme oil is used in perfumes. It is also used in soaps, cosmetics, and toothpastes.Fluoride salts are often added to municipal drinking water (as well as certain food products in some countries) for the purposes of maintaining dental health. The fluoride enhances the strength of teeth by the formation of fluorapatite, a naturally occurring component of tooth enamel. Toothpaste often contains sodium fluoride to prevent cavities, although tin(II) fluoride is generally considered superior for this application.","Local irritation of mouth, nausea & vomiting."
Etoricoxib,"Etoricoxib is a potent, orally active cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitor within, and significantly above, the clinical dose range. Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.","Side-effects may include palpitation, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, ecchymosis; less commonly dry mouth, taste disturbance, mouth ulcer, appetite and weight change, atrial fibrillation, transient ischaemic attack, chest pain, flushing, cough, dyspnoea, epistaxis, anxiety, mental acuity impaired, paraesthesia, electrolyte disturbance, myalgia and arthralgia; very rarely confusion and hallucinations."
Etoposide,"Etoposide is a derivative of podophyllotoxin that inhibits DNA synthesis resulting in the arrest of the cell cycle. At low doses, it inhibits cells from entering cell cycle and at high doses, cells entering mitosis are lysed.","Leukopenia, Nausea and Vomiting, Thrombocytopenia, Alopecia, Anorexia, Diarrhea, Leukopenia, Anemia, Pancytopenia, Stomatitis, Hepatic toxicity, Type 1 hypersensitivity, Orthostatic hypotension, Peripheral neuropathyMalaise,Shivering,Asthenia,Fever,Mucous membrane inflammation, Hyperuricemia, Local soft tissue toxicity has been reported following extravasation;"
Fluocinolone Acetonide,"Fluocinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid primarily used in dermatology to reduce skin inflammation and relieve itching. It is a synthetic hydrocortisone derivative. Fluocinolone acetonide was also found to strongly potentiate TGF-β-associated chondrogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells, by increasing the levels of collagen type II by more than 100 fold compared to the widely used dexamethasone.","Side-effects are extremely rare, but as with all topical corticosteroids, patient may show hypersensitivity reaction."
Flunarizine,Flunarizine is the difluorinated derivative of cinnarizine. It is a selective calcium channel antagonist. By reducing excessive transmembrane influx of calcium Flunarizine prevents cellular calcium overload. It does not interfere with normal cellular calcium homeostasis. Flunarizine also has some antihistaminic and sedative properties. It binds at an affinity of 99% to plasma protein.,"Drowsiness and/or fatigue, as well as weight gain and/or increased appetite may occur. The following adverse experiences have been reported during chronic treatment with Flunarizine: depression, of which female patients with a history of depressive illness may be particularly at risk; extrapyramidal symptoms (such as bradykinesia, rigidity, akathisia, orofacial dyskinesia, tremor), of which elderly patients seem particularly at risk. Infrequently reported adverse reaction are: heartburn; nausea; gastralgia; insomnia; anxiety; galactorrhoea; dry mouth; muscle ache; skin rash."
Fludrocortisone Acetate,Fludrocortisone binds the mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone receptor). This binding (or activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by fludrocortisone) in turn causes an increase in ion and water transport and thus raises extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure and lowers potassium levels.,"Most adverse reactions are caused by the drug’s mineralocorticoid activity (retention of sodium andwater) include erythema, purpura, vertigo, pancreatitis, increased intraocular pressure, muscular weakness, hypertension, edema, cardiac enlargement, congestive heart failure, steroid myopathy, peptic ulcer, osteoporosis, convulsions, menstrual irregularities, potassium loss, hypokalemic alkalosis, allergic and anaphylactic reaction etc. When Fludrocortisones is used in the small dosages recommended, side effects are not usually a problem; however the above mentioned unwanted effects should be kept in mind, particularly when Fludrocortisones is used over a prolonged period of time or in conjunction with cortisone or a similar glucocorticoid."
Fludarabine Phosphate,"Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2-fluoro-ara-A and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP. This metabolite appears to act by inhibiting DNA polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis leading to cell death. The mechanism of action of this antimetabolite is not completely characterized and may be multi-faceted.","Fever, chills, cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia; GI disturbances, stomatitis; oedema; tumour lysis syndrome; skin rashes; haemolytic anaemia, haemorrhagic cystitis; neurological disturbances including peripheral neuropathy, agitation, confusion, visual disturbances and coma. Progressive encephalopathy and blindness (high doses)."
Fluconazole (Ophthalmic),"Fluconazole is fungistatic in action. It inhibits cytochrome P-450 14-α demethylase in susceptible fungi which leads to accumulation of lanosterol and decreased concentration of ergosterol thereby altering cellular membrane resulting in increased membrane permeability, leakage of essential elements and impaired uptake of precursor molecules to DNA.",This drug is generally well tolerated. Eosinophillia has been reported in some patients.
Fluconazole,Fluconazole is a triazole antifungal agent. It is a potent inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P-450 dependent enzymes. Cytochrome P-450 enzyme system is essential component of fungal cell membrane which is responsible for the synthesis of ergosterol.,"Fluconazole is well tolerated. Most common side effects of using Fluconazole includes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache and skin rash."
Flucloxacillin Sodium,"Flucloxacillin is active against Gram-positive organisms including penicillinase producing strains. It has little activity against Gram-negative bacilli. Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.","There have been some common side effects of gastrointestinal tract such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and other minor gastrointestinal disturbances. Besides these rashes, urticaria, purpura, fever, interstitial nephritis, hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported."
Flibanserin,"Flibansetrin has high affinity for serotonin receptors in the brain: it acts as an agonist on 5-HT1A and an antagonist on 5-HT2A. In vivo, flibanserin binds equally to 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. However, under higher levels of brain 5-HT (i.e., under stress), flibanserin may occupy 5-HT2A receptors in higher proportion than 5-HT(1A) receptors. It may also moderately antagonize D4 (dopamine) receptors and 5-HT2B and 5-HTB2C. Its action on neurotransmitter receptors may contribute to reduction in serotonin levels and increase in dopamine and norepinephrine levels, all of which may play part in reward processing.","Most common adverse reactions are Dizziness, Somnolence, Nausea, Fatigue, Insomnia, Dry mouth."
Flavoxate Hydrochloride,"Flavoxate acts as a direct antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in cholinergically innervated organs. Its anticholinergic-parasympatholytic action reduces the tonus of smooth muscle in the bladder, effectively reducing the number of required voids, urge incontinence episodes, urge severity and improving retention, facilitating increased volume per void.","Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, dry mouth.CNS: Vertigo, headache, mental confusion, especially in the elderly, drowsiness, nervousness.Hematologic: Leukopenia (which is reversible upon discontinuation of the drug).Cardiovascular: Tachycardia and palpitation.Allergic: Urticaria and other dermatoses, eosinophilia and hyperpyrexia.Ophthalmic: Increased ocular tension, blurred vision, disturbance in eye accommodation."
Finerenone,"Finerenone is a nonsteroidal, selective antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which is activated by aldosterone and cortisol and regulates gene transcription. Finerenone blocks MR mediated sodium reabsorption and MR overactivation in both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart, and blood vessels) tissues. MR overactivation is thought to contribute to fibrosis and inflammation. Finerenone has a high potency and selectivity for the MR and has no relevant affinity for androgen, progesterone, estrogen, and glucocorticoid receptors.",The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hyperkalemia.
Finasteride [For B.P.H.],"Finasteride, a competitive inhibitor of the 5α reductase enzyme which is used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is selective for 5α reductase type 2 enzyme and has no affinity for androgen receptors. The development of the prostate gland and subsequent BPH is dependent upon conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) within the prostate. Finasteride belongs to a new class of specific inhibitors of 5α reductase, an intracellular enzyme, which metabolises testosterone into the more potent androgen, DHT. Finasteride has no affinity for the androgen receptor.","Finasteride is well tolerated. In clinical studies, the following adverse experiences have been reported as possibly drug related in 1% of patients treated for 12 months with 5 mg Finasteride daily: impotence (3.7%), decreased libido (3.3%), and decreased volume of ejaculate (2.8%)."
Finasteride [For Androgenic Alopecia],"Finasteride, a competitive inhibitor of steroid Type II 5α reductase, an intracellular enzyme that converts the androgen testosterone into 5α dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Finasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5α reductase, an intracellular enzyme that converts the androgen testosterone into DHT. Finasteride has no affinity for the androgen receptor and has no androgenic or antiandrogenic effects. Inhibition of Type II 5α reductase blocks the conversion of testosterone to DHT, resulting in significant decreases in serum and tissue DHT concentrations. In men with male pattern hair loss, the balding scalp contains miniaturised hair follicles and increased amounts of DHT compared with hairy scalp. Administration of Finasteride decreases scalp and serum DHT concentrations in these men.","Finasteride is well tolerated. In clinical studies, the following adverse reactions were reported as possibly drug related in >1% of patients treated for 12 months with Finasteride 1 mg daily : decreased libido (1.8%), erectile dysfunction (1.3%), ejaculation disorder (1.2%) and decreased volume of ejaculate (0.8%)."
Filgrastim,"Filgrastim is a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor which binds to cell surface receptors on haemetopoietic cells thus stimulating the development of granulocytes to increase their migration and cytotoxicity.Filgrastim is a glycoprotein which regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils from the bone marrow. Filgrastim causes marked increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dose-dependent at recommended doses. Following termination of Filgrastim therapy, circulating neutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days.","Musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, hypersensitivity reactions, splenic enlargement, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopaenia, anaemia, epistaxis, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, urinary abnormalities (dysuria, proteinuria, haematuria), osteoporosis, exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis, transient decrease in blood glucose, raised uric acid, cutaneous vasculitis, transient hypotension."
Fexofenadine Hydrochloride,Fexofenadine Hydrochloride is an antihistamine with selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist activity. It is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and peak plasma concentration is reached in 2-3 hours. It does not appear to cross the blood brain barrier.,"Common side effects are headache, fatigue, drowsiness, nausea, dry mouth and gastrointestinal disturbances."
Ferrous Sulfate + Folic Acid,"Iron is an essential constituent of the body, being necessary for haemoglobin formation and for the oxidative processes of living tissues. Iron is primarily absorbed from the duodenum and upper jejunum. The ferrous salt form is absorbed three times more readily than the ferric salt form. The adult male has a requirement of only 13 µg/kg per day (about 1 mg), whereas the menstruating female requires about 21 µg/kg per day (about 1.4 mg). In the last two trimesters of pregnancy, requirements increase to about 80 µg/kg per day (5 to 6 mg). Folic acid is an important factor in cell division and without it, division stops. Adequate folic acid is required for normal erythropoiesis. Deficiency of Folic Acid causes megaloblastic anaemia","Because iron salts are astringent, gastrointestinal irritation may occur. Nausea and epigastric pain are dose related."
Ferrous Gluconate,"Ferrous gluconate is used in the prevention and treatment of iron-deficiency anaemia. It replaces iron found in haemoglobin, myoglobin and enzymes. It also allows transportation of oxygen via haemoglobin.","GI symptoms e.g. stomach cramping, constipation, nausea, vomiting, dark stools, heartburn, diarrhea, teeth staining, urine discoloration."
Ferrous Fumarate + Folic acid,"Iron is an essential constituent of the body being necessary for haemoglobin formation and for the oxidative processes of living tissues. Iron salts should only be given for the treatment and as prophylaxis of Iron deficiency anaemia. Iron deficiency anaemias are most often the result of chronic haemorrhage, nutritional deficiency, pregnancy or parasite infestation or malabsorption of iron. A deficiency of Folic acid typically during pregnancy has long been known to cause a megaloblastic anaemia. The vitamin is not storable in the body and the combination of fetal demand during pregnancy and malnutrition can lead to a deficiency, hence anaemia. It has been observed that the rapid production of red blood cells following treatment with iron may deplete body folate if there is inadequate intake; combination of folic acid and ferrous fumerate avoids the complication. Iron and Folic acid are absorbed in the proximal small intestine particularly the duodenum. Ferrous Fumerate & Folic acid supplements replenish iron deficiency. Thereby arresting the anaemia process. Absorbed iron is taken upto the bone marrow's tissues that form blood cells where it is used to synthesize haemoglobin.","Gastric distress, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, allergic reaction."
Ferrous Fumarate,Ferrous fumarate is an iron preparation that is used in the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency. The amount of elemental iron is 330 mg/g of ferrous fumarate.,"Like all medicines, Ferrous Fumarate Tablets can sometimes cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. They might be:

Heartburn
Feeling sick or being sick
Diarrhoea or constipation.

Also, you might find your stools are darker in color after you have taken this medicine. This is quite commonly seen with all iron preparations and is normal."
Fluticasone Propionate (Nasal Spray),"Following topical administration into the nasal mucosa, Fluticasone propionate produces anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictor effects. The exact mechanism of these actions remains unknown but may involve a reduction in the following: number of mediator cells (basophil, leukocytes and mast cells) at the epithelial level, number of eosinophils, the sensitivity of sensory nerves to mechanical stimuli, secretory response to cholinergic receptor stimulation, and fibroblast activity. Other mechanisms may involve - inhibition of capillary dilation and permeability, stabilization of lysosomal membranes and subsequent prevention of release of proteolytic enzymes.","Fluticasone Propionate nasal spray is absorbed less into the rest of the body, therefore fewer side effects are seen. With the nasal spray, drying of the nose and throat, unpleasant taste and smell and an increase in the incidence of nosebleeds may occur."
Fluticasone Propionate (Inhaler),"Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity.  Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma.Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When corticosteroids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer.Trials in subjects with asthma have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects with recommended doses of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, negligible oral systemic bioavailability (<1%), and the minimal pharmacological activity of the only metabolite detected in man.","Most common adverse reactions (incidence >3%) are upper respiratory tract infection or inflammation, throat irritation, sinusitis, dysphonia, candidiasis, cough, bronchitis, and headache."
Fluticasone Furoate,"Fluticasone Furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with potent anti inflammatory activity. Like other corticosteroids Fluticasone Furoate is found to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g.- histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation.","Fluticasone Furoate nasal spray is absorbed less into the rest of the body, therefore fewer side effects are seen. With the nasal spray, drying of the nose and an increase in the incidence of nosebleeds may occur.Most common adverse reactions of Fluticasone Furoate inhalation capsule reported in ≥5% of adult and adolescent subjects are nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache. Most common adverse reactions reported in ≥3% of pediatric subjects aged 5 to 11 years are pharyngitis, bronchitis, and viral infection."
Flutamide,Flutamide is a nonsteroidal 'pure' antiandrogen which acts directly on the target tissues either by blocking androgen uptake or by inhibiting cytoplasmic and nuclear binding of androgen.,"Hot flushes, loss of libido, impotence, gynaecomastia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, increased appetite, sleep disturbances, skin reactions, anaemias, headache, dizziness, malaise, anxiety, hypertension, gastric and chest pain, oedema, blurred vision, hepatitis, jaundice, rash, thirst, pruritus, SLE-like syndrome, drowsiness, confusion, depression, nervousness."
Flurbiprofen,Flurbiprofen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by decreasing the activity of cyclooxygenase resulting in reduced prostaglandin levels. It is also a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation.,"Oedema, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn, liver enzyme elevations, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, wt change, headache, nervousness, CNS stimulation (e.g. anxiety), CNS inhibition (e.g. somnolence), rhinitis, vision changes, dizziness/vertigo, tinnitus, signs and symptoms of UTI, rash. Ocular hyperaemia, eye irritation, fibrosis, miosis, mydriasis."
Flurazepam,"Flurazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, is a hypnotic agent which does not appear to decrease dream time as measured by rapid eye movements (REM). Furthermore, it decreases sleep latency and number of awakenings for a consequent increase in total sleep time. Flurazepam binds to an allosteric site on GABA-A receptors. Binding potentiates the action of GABA on GABA-A receptors by opening the chloride channel within the receptor, causing chloride influx and hyperpolarization.","Dizziness, drowsiness, light-headedness, staggering, ataxia have occurred, particularly in elderly or debilitated persons. Severe sedation, lethargy, disorientation and coma have been reported."
Fluphenazine Decanoate,"Fluphenazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis.","The side effects include tardive dyskinesia, sedation, mental confusion; hypotension; hyperprolactinaemia leading to galactorrhoea and amenorrhoea in women; loss of libido, impotence and sterility in males. Also include allergic reactions, cholestatic jaundice, corneal and lens deposists, skin pigmentation. Other potential adverse reactions are agranulocytosis; neuroleptic syndrome."
Fluphenazine + Nortriptyline,"Nortriptyline hydrochloride is a tricyclic antidepressant. Nortriptyline inhibits the uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin at nerve terminals. In contrast to its parent compound amitriptyline which is equally potent in inhibiting the uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, Nortriptyline has a greater effect on norepinephrine reuptake than on serotonin reuptake.Fluphenazine is a tranquilizer of the phenothiazine type with piperazine side chain. Fluphenazine primarily acts as a neuroleptic drug whose main therapeutic effect is believed to reside in potent dopamine (specially D2) receptor antagonism.","Tardive dyskinesias have been reported in phenothiazine therapy; usually after prolonged courses given at doses adequately to control psychotic illness. Blood dyscrasia, Malignant Neuroleptic syndrome and sudden death have been reported rarely. Agranulocytosis is a rare but potentially fatal adverse effect of Nortriptyline Hydrochloride."
Flupentixol + Melitracen,"This consists of two well known and well proven compounds: flupentixol-a neuroleptic with anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of its own when given in small doses, and melitracen-a bipolar thymoleptic with activating properties in low doses. In combination the compounds render a preparation with antidepressant, anxiolytic and activating properties. Maximal serum concentration is reached in about 4 hours after oral administration of flupentixol and in about 4 hours after oral administration of melitracen. The biological half-life of flupentixol is about 35 hours and that of melitracen is about 19 hours. The combination of flupentixol and melitracen does not seem to influence the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual compounds.",In the recommended doses side effects are rare. These could be transient restlessness and insomnia.
Flupentixol,Flupentixol is a thioxanthene antipsychotic that inhibits dopamine-mediated effects by blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the CNS.,"Rigidity, tremors, restlessness, tardive dyskinesia, insomnia, dryness of mouth, wt gain, sexual dysfunction, galactorrhoea and menstrual disturbances.Potentially Fatal: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (hyperthermia, hypertonicity of skeletal muscles, unconsciousness and autonomic nervous system instability)."
Fluoxetine Hydrochloride,"Fluoxetine has been shown to selectively inhibit the reuptake of serotonin at the presynaptic neuronal membrane which causes increased synaptic concentration of serotonin in the CNS. This result in numerous functional changes associated with enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. Fluoxetine appears to have no effect on the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine and does not exhibit anticholinergic, antihistaminic or α1 adrenergic blocking activity at usual therapeutic doses.","Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, dry mouth, and diarrhoea.Neurological: Anxiety, nervousness, insomnia/ drowsiness and fatigue.Others: Excessive sweating, pruritus, skin rashes associated with liver, kidney and lung involvement. It has therefore been advised that Fluoxetine therapy should be discontinued in any patient who develops a skin rash."
Fluorouracil,"Fluorouracil is inactive as such in mammalian cells but is converted into the active 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) by a variety of different metabolic pathways. The drug works by inhibiting the enzyme thymidylate kinase which results in reduced formation of thymidine and thus of DNA. The active metabolite FdUMP appears to form a stable complex with the folate cofactor N-5, 10-methylene tetrahydrofolate which inactivates thymidylate kinase. Fluorouracil as FdUMP is also incorporated into RNA which results in fluorination of RNA. The effect of fluorouracil on living cells is limited mainly to those in the proliferative phase but while cells in the G2 and S phase are most affected there may be effects at any stage of the cell cycle.","Potentially life-threatening effects: Severe effects from 5-fluorouracil are related to the dosage and duration of therapy.Cardiac effects: Occasional case reports associating 5-fluorouracil therapy with 'ischemic cardiac events' evidence against the autoimmune phenomenon is the fact that in several cases cardiotoxicity occurred within several hours of the first dose.Hematological effects: Potentially lethal effects caused by severe hematological toxicity may develop within the first 10 days of treatment being instituted but generally resolves within 3 weeks. At the recommended dose and schedule it is rather uncommon for hematological toxicity to be severe. Any ontribute to severe effects from 5-fluorouracil on the blood-forming cells. Thus extensive prior irradiation or the concomitant use of cytotoxic drugs tend to exacerbate the severity of the hematological side effects of 5-fluorouracil.Neurological effects: Effects on the central nervous system have been occasionally reported and cerebral ataxia is dose-dependent with an incidence of between 3.1 and 7%. Acute cerebellar syndromes and myelopathy have been described following intrathecal 5-fluorouracil. Neurological syndromes may occur rarely after carotid artery perfusion in head and neck cancer. Other effects Allergic reaction (including difficulty in breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, or hives), decreased bone marrow function and blood problems (extreme fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, black, bloody or tarry stools, or fever, chills, or signs of infection), hand-foot syndrome (tingling, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness of the hands and feet), severe vomiting, diarrhoea, frequent bowel movements or watery stools, or sores in the mouth or throat, or stomach pain or heartburn or black, bloody or tarry stools. Other less serious side effects may include mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite, balance problems, confusion, rash and itching, or temporary hair loss. Conjunctivitis, both acute and chronic can proceed to tear duct stenosis and ectropion following prolonged administration. Very chronic administration, extending beyond 3 months, of low dosage has been associated with low systemic toxicity but includes the possibility of painful and tender hands and feet associated with erythema of the extremities."
Fluorometholone Acetate,"Fluorometholone is a corticosteroid with an excellent anti-inflammatory action with no significant influence on the intraocular pressure. The anti-inflammatory activity of Fluorometholone is at least 40 times stronger than that of Hydrocortisone. Corticosteroids are thought to act by the introduction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandin and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. In comparison with other corticosteroids Fluorometholone is more rapidly degraded in tissue and therefore has less effect on the intraocular pressure. The immunosuppressive action of Fluorometholone is less pronounced than that of Dexamethasone.","Glaucoma with optic nerve damage, visual acuity or field defects, cataract formation, secondary ocular infection following suppression of host immunity, perforation of the globe."
Fluorometholone + Tetrahydrozoline,"Fluorometholone is thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. On the other hand, Tetrahydrozoline is an alpha agonist which constricts the conjunctival blood vessels and thereby relieves the redness of the eye.","Mild burning sensation, reversible increase in intraocular pressure, reactive hyperemia, cataract & corneal defects, glaucoma, systemic effects (chronic use)."
Fluorometholone + Gentamicin,"Gentamicin belongs to the group of aminoglycoside antibiotics. It covers a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococci, Haemophilus influenzae H. aegypticus, Klebsiella, Enterobacteria, Proteus, Escherichia coli, Shigella and Salmonella. It inhibits specifically bacterial protein synthesis. Fluorometholone is a synthetic fluorinated corticosteroid possessing anti-inflammatory properties. The combination brings concomitantly the bacterial treatment or prophylaxis and the anti-inflammatory effect. In addition, the presence of gentamicin protects from a risk of potential aggravation of a bacterial infection due to the steroid.","A transient burning sensation may occur after instillation. Rare: Hypersensitivity reactions including eczema of the eyelid and puncture keratitis. Prolonged use of topical steroids may delay wound healing, increase of IOP, develop cataract and cause thinning of cornea & sclera."
Fluormetholone + Neomycin Sulphate,"There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Their primary target is the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes.Like other aminoglycoside antibiotic drugs, neomycin inhibits bacterial ribosomes by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria and disrupting the translational machinery of bacterial protein synthesis. Bacterial translation is normally initiated by the mRNA binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and subsequent binding with 50S subunit for elongation.","The following side effects may occur: Increased eye pressure (glaucoma), loss of part of the usual field of vision, blurred vision, cataracts (cloudy lens), eye irritation, red eye, eye pain, foreign body sensation, eyelid or eye swelling, itchy or watery eye, ulcers on the surface of the eye, secondary eye infections from fungi or viruses, skin rash, allergic reactions, change in your sense of taste."
Fluorescein Sodium,"Fluorescein sodium responds to electromagnetic radiation and light between the wavelengths of 465- 490 nm and fluoresces, i.e., emits light at wavelengths of 520-530 nm. Thus, the hydrocarbon is excited by blue light and emits light that appears yellowish-green. Following intravenous injection of fluorescein sodium in an aqueous solution, the unbound fraction of the fluorescein can be excited with a blue light flash from a fundus camera as it circulates through the ocular vasculature, and the yellowish green fluorescence of the dye is captured by the camera. In the fundus, the fluorescence of the dye demarcates the retinal and/or choroidal vasculature under observation, distinguishing it from adjacent areas/structures.","Nausea and vomiting (IV); extravasation is painful; hypersensitivity reactions; transient yellow coloration of skin and urine; staining of the skin, clothing and soft contact lenses."
Fluocinolone Acetonide + Neomycin Sulfate,"Fluocinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid primarily used in dermatology to reduce skin inflammation and relieve itching. It is a synthetic hydrocortisone derivative. Fluocinolone acetonide was also found to strongly potentiate TGF-β-associated chondrogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells, by increasing the levels of collagen type II by more than 100 fold compared to the widely used dexamethasone.Neomycin Sulfate actively transported across the bacterial cell membrane, binds to a specific receptor protein on the 30 S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, and interferes with an initiation complex between mRNA (messenger RNA) and the 30 S subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis.","Side-effects are extremely rare, but as with all topical corticosteroids, patient may show hypersensitivity reaction."
Fluocinolone Acetonide + Hydroquinone + Tretinoin,"This cream contains three active ingredients Fluocinolone Acetonide, Hydroquinone and Tretinoin. All of them are used to treat melasma. However, the mechanism of action of the active ingredients in This cream in the treatment of melasma is unknown but Fluocinolone Acetonide is a corticosteroid for topical dermatological use and is classified therapeutically as an anti-inflammatory. Hydroquinone is classified therapeutically as a depigmenting agent, which may interrupt one or more steps in the tyrosine-tyrosinase pathway of melanin synthesis. Tretinoin is classified therapeutically as a keratolytic agent.","A very few patients may get severe allergic reactions from this cream. They may have trouble breathing or severe asthma attacks. While patients use this cream, skin may develop mild to moderate redness, peeling, burning, dryness or itching."
Fluocinolone Acetonide + Clioquinol,"Fluocinolone is a type of medicine called a topical corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are medicines used for reducing inflammation. Inflammation of the skin happens as a result of allergy or irritation of the skin, and is caused by the release of various substances that are important in the immune system. These substances cause blood vessels to widen and result in the irritated area becoming red, swollen, itchy and painful, such as is seen in dermatitis or eczema.When fluocinolone is applied to the skin it works by acting inside the cells to decrease the release of these inflammatory substances. This reduces swelling, redness and itch.There is a range of potencies of corticosteroids available for application to the skin. This medicine contains fluocinolone 0.025% and is classed as a potent corticosteroid. It is prescribed to treat various inflammatory skin disorders, such as eczema and dermatitis, that have not responded to milder steroids.Clioquinol has antifungal and antibacterial actions. It works by preventing the growth and multiplication of the organisms. The combination of fluocinolone and clioquinol is used to treat inflammatory skin disorders that are either infected or likely to become infected.This cream is more suitable for moist, weeping areas of skin, while the thicker, more greasy ointment is more suitable for dry, scaly areas of skin.","Medicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. Just because a side effect is stated here, it does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. The following side effects are known to be associated with this medicine.

Skin irritation at site of application, such as burning, itching and redness.
Allergic inflammation of the skin (contact dermatitis).
Thinning of the skin.
Changes in skin pigmentation.
Stretch marks (striae).
Groupings of fine blood vessels becoming prominent under the skin (telangiectasia)."
Fusidic Acid (Ophthalmic),Fusidic acid is an antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Fusidic acid interferes with amino acid transfer from aminoacyl-tRNA to protein on the ribosomes. Fusidic acid is active against a wide range of gram-positive organisms. The sustained release formulation ensures prolonged contact with the conjunctival sac. Fusidic acid penetrates well into the aqueous humor.,Fusidic acid is generally associated with very few adverse effects. The most frequently reported treatment-related side-effect is slight stinging or irritation.
Furosemide + Spironolactone,"Spironolactone (potassium sparing diuretic) and Furosemide (loop diuretic) have different but complementary mechanisms and sites of action. Therefore, when given together they produce additive or synergistic diuretic. The Furosemide component inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transporter in the ascending Loop of Henle and blocks the reabsorption of sodium, potassium and chloride ions; thereby increasing the quantity of sodium and the volume of water excreted in the urine. This characteristically induces potassium loss. The spironolactone component inhibits the reabsorption of sodium in exchange for potassium at the distal tubule by antagonising the action of aldosterone so that sodium excretion is greatly favoured and the excess loss of potassium, induced by the Furosemide, is reduced","Spironolactone may give rise to headache and drowsiness and gastrointestinal distress, including cramp and diarrhoea. Ataxia, mental confusion, and skin rashes have been reported as side effect. Gynaecomastia is not uncommon and in rare cases breast enlargement may persist. Other endocrine disorders including hirsutism, deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities and impotence. Transient increase in blood-urea-nitrogen concentrations may occur and mild acidosis has been reported. Spironolactone may cause hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Excessive diuresis may result in dehydration and reduction in blood volume with circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism particularly in elderly patients. Serious depletion of potassium and magnesium may lead to cardiac arrhythmias."
Furosemide,"Furosemide is a monosulphonyl diuretic. It is an effective diuretic that retains its activity even in low glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Furosemide has a distinctive action on renal tubular function. It affects a peak diuresis far greater than that observed with other agents. Other features are (I) prompt onset of action (II) inhibition of sodium and chloride transport in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and (III) independence of their action from acid-base balance changes. Furosemide acts primarily to inhibit electrolyte reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Furosemide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and considerable proportions are bound to plasma proteins. It is rapidly excreted in the urine. With an hour after intravenous injection, its effect is evident in about 5 minutes and last for about 2 hours.","As with other diuretics, electrolytes and water balance may be disturbed as a result of diuresis of prolonged therapy. Prolonged use can produce alkalosis. It may also cause uric acid retention and may rarely produce acute gout. Furosemide may provoke hyperglycemia and glycosuria."
Fucidic Acid + Betamethasone,"Betamethasone is a topical fluorinated corticosteroid that has an anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effect. Fusidic acid is a potent topical antibacterial agent which is effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, Corynebacteria, Neiserria and certain Clostridia and Bacteroides.","Hypersensitivity, contact dermatitis, eczema (aggravated condition), skin burning sensation, pruritus, dry skin, application site pain or irritation. Rarely, erythema, urticaria (including rash erythematous and generalised rash), application site swelling or vesicles."
Fosfomycin Trometamol,"Fosfomycin has in vitro activity against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms, associated with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Fosfomycin Trometamol is a phosphonic acid derivative. It is a synthetic, broad spectrum, bactericidal antibiotic for oral administration. The bactericidal action of Fosfomycin is due to its inactivation of the enzyme enolpyruvyl transferase, thereby irreversibly blocking the condensation of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine with p-enolpyruvate, one of the first steps in bacterial cell wall synthesis.","In clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse events occurring in >1% of the study population regardless of drug relationship were: diarrhea 10.4%, headache 10.3%, vaginitis 7.6%, nausea 5.2%, rhinitis 4.5%, back pain 3.0%, dysmenorrhea 2.6%, pharyngitis 2.5%, dizziness 2.3%, abdominal pain 2.2%, pain 2.2%, dyspepsia 1.8%, asthenia 1.7%, and rash 1.4%.The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials at a rate of less than 1%, regardless of drug relationship: abnormal stools, anorexia, constipation, dry mouth, dysuria, ear disorder, fever, flatulence, flu syndrome, hematuria, infection, insomnia, lymphadenopathy, menstrual disorder, migraine, myalgia, nervousness, paresthesia, pruritus, SGPT increased, skin disorder, somnolence, and vomiting."
Formoterol Fumarate + Glycopyrrolate + Budesonide,"This Inhaler is a pressurized metered-dose inhaler that delivers a combination of micronized Budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), micronized glycopyrrolate (an anticholinergic), and micronized formoterol fumarate, an inhaled long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (a LABA), for oral inhalation. ICS medicines such as budesonide help to decrease inflammation in the lungs. Inflammation in the lungs can lead to breathing problems. Anticholinergic medicines, such as glycopyrrolate, and LABA medicines, such as formoterol fumarate help the muscles around the airways in the lungs stay relaxed to prevent symptoms, such as wheezing, cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.","Serious asthma-related events-hospitalizations, intubations, death, Candida albicans infection, increased risk of pneumonia, immunosuppression and risk of infections, hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, paradoxical bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, cardiovascular effects, reduction in bone mineral density, worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma and cataracts, worsening of urinary retention"
Formoterol Fumarate,"Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonist (β2-agonist). Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. In vitro studies have shown that formoterol has more than 200-fold greater agonist activity at β2-receptors than at β1-receptors. Although β2-receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and β1-receptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also β2-receptors in the human heart comprising 10%-50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective β2-agonists may have cardiac effects.The pharmacologic effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.In vitro tests show that formoterol is an inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, from the human lung. Formoterol also inhibits histamine-induced plasma albumin extravasation in anesthetized guinea pigs and inhibits allergen-induced eosinophil influx in dogs with airway hyper-responsiveness. The relevance of these in vitro and animal findings to humans is unknown.","Common side effects are Viral infection, Bronchitis, Chest infection, Dyspnea , Chest pain, Tremor, Dizziness, Angina, Arrhythmias, Hypo/hypertension, Tachycardia, Hypokalemia, Hyperglycemia, Metabolic acidosis, Headache, Insomnia, Paradoxical bronchospasm, Severe asthma exacerbation"
Fondaparinux Sodium,"Fondaparinux, a synthetic pentasaccharide, acts as a selective inhibitor of activated factor X. It works by binding selectively to antithrombin III and potentiates the neutralisation of factor Xa. This will interrupt the blood coagulation cascade and inhibit both thrombin formation and thrombus development.","Hip-fracture, hip-replacement, or knee-replacement surgery: Anaemia, fever, nausea, oedema, constipation, rash, vomiting, insomnia, increased wound drainage, hypokalaemia, UTI, dizziness, purpura, hypotension, confusion, bullous eruption, urinary retention, haematoma, major bleeding, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, post-op haemorrhage, and headache. Treatment of venous thromboembolism: Constipation, headache, insomnia, fever, nausea, UTI, and coughing. Abdominal surgery: Post-op wound infection and haemorrhage, fever, surgical site reaction, anaemia, HTN, pneumonia, vomiting."
Follitropin Beta,Follitropin beta is a human FSH preparation of recombinant DNA origin. It stimulates ovarian follicular growth in women who do not have primary ovarian failure.,"Ovarian cysts, mild to severe inj site reactions, headache, mild to moderate OHSS, abdominal pain, GI disturbances. Rarely, severe OHSS, ovarian torsion, thromboembolism, mild systemic allergic reactions."
Follitropin Alfa,Follitropin alfa is a human FSH preparation of recombinant DNA origin. It stimulates ovarian follicular growth in women who do not have primary ovarian failure and stimulates spermatogenesis in men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.,"Ovarian cysts, mild to severe Inj site reactions, headache, mild to moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), abdominal pain, GI disturbances. Rarely, severe OHSS, ovarian torsion, thromboembolism, mild systemic allergic reactions."
Follicle Stimulating Hormone [Urofollitropin],"FSH is a product containing a highly purified preparation of human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH-HP) extracted from the urine of postmenopausal women. Third generation of urinary gonadotrophins FSH-HP;Use of monoclonal antibodies specific to FSH resulted in further refinements in manufacture, and the production of highly purified (HP) urinary FSH. The presence of LH is less than 0.1% per 75 IU of FSH & Unidentified urinary proteins are less than 5% in Human FSH-HP. FSH consists of two non-covalently linked glycoproteins designated as the alfa and beta subunits. The alfa subunit has 92 amino acids of which two are modified by attachment of carbohydrates. The beta subunit has 111 amino acids of which two are modified by attachment of carbohydrates. FSH is a sterile, lyophilized powder intended for subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection after reconstitution with sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Each vial of FSH contains 75 International Units (IU) of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) which is reconstituted with diluents. The in vivo biological activity of Urofollitropin (FSH) for injection, purified is determined by using reference standards calibrated against the First International Standard for follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH, Urofollitropin), Urinary, and Human for Bioassay, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) at its 46th meeting in 1995. FSH is a glycoprotein that is acidic and water-soluble.","FSH sometimes excites the ovaries too much. This may cause pelvic pain or breathing problems. It may also make you urinate less. In rare cases, patients with this problem have had serious lung problems, including fluid in the lungs, troublebreathing, and worsening of asthma blood clots and strokes, severe pelvic pain, chest pain, or abdominal pain, Nausea, Vomiting, Sudden weight gain, Bloating, Trouble, breathing. FSH may cause twins or multiple births. The most common side effects with FSH are headache, vaginal bleeding, nausea, and hot flashes. Sometimes there is a reaction at the spot where you give yourself the injection. This can include bruising, pain, or redness."
Folic Acid + Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate,"This tablet is a special preparation of Folic Acid & Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate. Zinc is an essential trace element required for human nutrition and involved in a number of body enzyme system. Severe Zinc deficiency causes skin lesion, alopecia, diarrhoea, increased susceptibility of infections, cognitive impairment, etc. Folic Acid is a member of the B-Vitamins group. It is reduced in the body to tetrahydrofolate, which is the coenzyme for various metabolic processes including the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, and hence the synthesis of DNA. It is also involved in some amino acid conversions. Deficiency of Folic Acid may cause megaloblastic anaemia, develops when the dietary intake is inadequate, as in malnutrition, from malabsorption, from increased utilization as in pregnancy of conditions such as haemolytic anaemia, and as a result of administration of folate antagonists.","Folic Acid & Zinc is well tolerated in the recommended dose. Occasionally gastrointestinal disturbances like abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, fever and respiratory distress may occur."
Folic Acid,"Folic acid, as it is biochemically inactive, is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid and methyltetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.",Folic acid is generally well tolerated. Gastro-intestinal disturbances may occur. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported rarely.
Fluvoxamine Maleate,"The exact mechanism of action of fluvoxamine has not been fully determined but appears to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin. Fluvoxamine blocks the reuptake of serotonin at the serotonin reuptake pump of the neuronal membrane, enhancing the actions of serotonin on 5HT1A autoreceptors. Studies have also demonstrated that fluvoxamine has virtually no affinity for α1- or α2-adrenergic, β-adrenergic, muscarinic, dopamine D2, histamine H1, GABA-benzodiazepine, opiate, 5-HT1, or 5-HT2 receptors, despite having an affinity for binding to σ1 receptors.","Most common reactions in controlled trials with adult OCD and depression patients (incidence ≥5% and at least twice that for placebo) were nausea, somnolence, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, dyspepsia, abnormal ejaculation, sweating, anorexia, tremor, and vomiting. Using the above rule, the following events were also identified: anorgasmia, decreased libido, dry mouth, rhinitis, taste perversion, and urinary frequency in patients with OCD; and agitation, depression, dysmenorrhea, flatulence, hyperkinesia, and rash in pediatric patients with OCD."
Fluvastatin,"Fluvastatin acts by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme for cholesterol synthesis. It reduces total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and VLDL concentrations in plasma. It also increases HDL concentrations.","Headache, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, bronchitis, sinusitis, insomnia, fatigue, myopathy, myalgia and UTI. Increased blood creatinine phosphokinase and transaminase."
Fluticasone Propionate + Formoterol Fumarate,"This inhaler (a pressurised inhalation, suspension) which contains two active ingredients:

Fluticasone propionate which belongs to a group of medicines called steroids. Steroids help to reduce swelling and inflammation in the lungs.
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate which belongs to a group of medicines called long-acting beta 2 agonists. Long-acting beta 2 agonists are long-acting bronchodilators which help the airways in your lungs to stay open, making it easier for you to breathe.

Together these two active ingredients help to improve your breathing. It is advised that you should use this medicine every day as directed by your doctor or asthma nurse.This medicine helps to prevent breathing problems such as asthma and helps to stop you becoming breathless and wheezy. However, it does not work if you are already having an asthma attack i.e. you are already breathless and wheezing. You will need to use a fast acting ‘reliever’ medicine such as salbutamol if this happens.","Undesirable effects which have been associated with this inhaler during clinical development are given in the table below, listed by system organ class. The following frequency categories form the basis for classification of the undesirable effects as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 and <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 and <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 < 1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness."
Fluticasone Propionate (Topical),"Fluticasone propionate is a glucocorticoid with high topical anti-inflammatorypotency, but a low HPA-axis suppressive activity after dermal administration. It, therefore, has a therapeutic index which is greater than most of the commonly available steroids. Fluticasone propionate has a high degree of selectivity for the glucocorticoid receptor. In vitro studies show that fluticasone propionate has a strong affinity for, and agonist activity at, human glucocorticoid receptors. This receptor is believed to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids. Fluticasone propionate has weak affinity forthe progesterone receptor, andvirtually no affinity for the mineralocorticoid, estrogen, or androgen receptors. The therapeutic potency of glucocorticoids is related to the half-life of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex. The half-life of the Fluticasone propionate glucocorticoid-receptor complex is approximately 10 hours.","The fluticasone propionate preparations are usually well tolerated; local burning and pruritus have been reported. If signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Prolonged and intensive treatment with potent corticosteroid preparations may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae, dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, hypertrichosis and hypopigmentation. Secondary infection, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved and allergic contact dermatitis have also been reported with corticosteroid use. Exacerbation of the signs and symptoms of the dermatoses have been reported with corticosteroid use. Prolonged use of large amounts of corticosteroids, or treatment of extensive areas, can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism. This effect is more likely to occur in infants and children, and if occlusive dressings are used. In infants, the napkin may act as an occlusive dressing."
Fluticasone Propionate (Nebuliser Suspension),"Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic, trifluorinated glucocorticoid with potent anti-inflammatory activity. In vitro assays using human lung cytosol preparations have established fluticasone propionate as a human glucocorticoid receptor agonist with an affinity 18 times greater than dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results.The precise mechanisms of glucocorticoid action in asthma are unknown. Inflammation is recognized as an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) and mediator production or secretion (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in the asthmatic response. These anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.Though highly effective for the treatment of asthma, glucocorticoids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. However, improvement following inhaled administration of fluticasone propionate can occur within 24 hours of beginning treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When glucocorticoids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer.","Candidiasis of the mouth and throat and/or hoarseness is commonly reported. Patients may find it helpful to rinse out their mouth with water after inhalation. As with other inhalation therapy, paradoxical bronchospasm may occur rarely, with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. There have also been rare reports of hypersensitivity reactions manifesting as angioedema, bronchospasm and very rarely, anaphylactic reactions. Other adverse events that may occur rarely include depression of plasma cortisol in adult patients on higher doses, bone density reduction, growth retardation, cataract, glaucoma."
Glibenclamide,Glibenclamide is an orally effective hypoglycaemic agent that reduces blood sugar concentration by stimulating secretion of endogenous insulin from the pancreatic β-cells. It stimulates the mobilization of endogenous insulin with a lower dosage and with few incidence of side effects that any available anti-diabetic. Hypoglycaemic action associated with short-term therapy appears to include reduction of basal hepatic glucose production and enhancement of peripheral insulin action at target sites.,"Glibenclamide is well tolerated. Few side effects that may arise include nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, dizziness, weakness, paraesthesia and headache. Allergic skin reactions and haemopoietic reactions (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, etc.) are occasionally observed."
Glecaprevir + Pibrentasvir,"Glecaprevir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease, which is a viral enzyme necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins. These multifunctional proteins, including NS3, are essential for viral replication. The N-terminal of NS3 protein confers serine protease activity, whileThe C-terminus of NS3 encodes a DExH/D-box RNA helicase which hydyolyzes NTP as an energy source to unwind double-stranded RNA in a 3′ to 5′ direction during replication of viral genomic RNA. NS4A is a cofactor for NS3 that directs the localization of NS3 and modulates its enzymatic activities. Glecaprevir disrupts the intracellular processes of the viral life cycle through inhibiting the NS3/4A protease activity of cleaving downstream junctions of HCV polypeptide and proteolytic processing of mature structural protein.NS5A is a phosphoprotein that plays an essential role in replication, assembly and maturation of infectious viral proteins. The basal phosphorylated form of NS5A, which is maintained by C-terminal serine cluster, is key in ensuring its interaction with the viral capsid protein, or the core protein. By blocking this interaction, pibrentasvir inhibits the assembly of proteins and production of mature HCV particles. NS5A also interacts with viral and cellular proteins to form the HCV replicase complex, and supports the RNA replication of HCV","In subjects receiving this preparation, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (greater than 10%) are headache and fatigue."
Gentian Violet,"In aqueous solutions Gentian violet (GV) dissociates into positive (GV+)and negative ions (Cl-) that penetrate through the wall and membrane of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial cells. The GV+ interacts with negatively charged components of bacterial cells including the lipopolysaccharide (on the cell wall), the peptidoglycan and DNA. A similar cell penetration and DNA binding process is thought to take place for fungal cells as well. Because Gentian violet is a mutagen and mitotic poison, cell growth is consequently inhibited. A photodynamic action of gentian violet, apparently mediated by a free-radical mechanism, has recently been described in bacteria and in the protozoan T. cruzi. Evidence also suggests that gentian violet dissipates the bacterial (and mitochondrial) membrane potential by inducing permeability. This is followed by respiratory inhibition. This anti-mitochondrial activity might explain gentian violet's efficacy towards both bacteria and yeast with relatively mild effects on mammalian cells.","Redness, irritation, swelling or pain persists or increases of if infection occurs."
Gentamicin Sulfate (Topical),"Gentamicin Sulphate is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It is a proven bactericidal antibiotic active against Gram-positive & Gram-negative pathogens including E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and penicillin resistant strains of Staph. aureus. In common with other aminoglycoside antibiotics, it appears to interfere with protein synthesis of the bacterial cell.","Itching, redness, swelling or other signs of irritation."
Gentamicin Sulfate (Ophthalmic),"Gentamicin sulphate  actively transported across the bacterial cell membrane, binds to a specific receptor protein on the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes and interferes with an initiation complex between mRNA (messenger RNA) and the 30 S subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis. DNA may be misread, thus producing nonfunctional proteins; polyribosomes are split apart and are unable to synthesize protein.Eye drops may be absorbed following topical application to the eye. Ear drops may be absorbed following topical application to the ear, especially if the eardrum is perforated or if tissue damage is present.Gentamicin sulphate is active against many strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Niesseria gonorrhoea, Pseudomonus aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens.","In patients with dermatoses treated with gentamicin, irritation (erythema and pruritus) had been reported in small number of cases. Itching, redness, swelling or other signs of irritation may develop. With the eye/ear drop bacterial and corneal ulcer have developed during treatment with gentamicin. Most frequently reported adverse reactions are ocular burning and irritation upon drug instillation, non specific conjunctivitis, conjunctival epithelial defects, and conjunctival hyperemia."
Gentamicin Sulfate (Injection),"Gentamicin Sulfate is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. This is a proven bactericidal antibiotic active against a broad spectrum of Gram-negative pathogens including E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus spp, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia species. It is also active against some Gram-positive organisms (e.g. penicillin & methicillin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus). In vitro, Gentamicin is also active against Salmonella and Shigella. Gentamicin interferes with bacterial protein synthesis by binding primarily to the 30S sub-units of bacterial ribosomes in susceptible organisms. Cell death results. Other mechanisms of action may contribute to the bactericidal effect of Gentamicin.","Vestibular damage, reversible nephrotoxicity, auditory ototoxicity may occur. Symptoms are dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, rarely hearing loss. Adverse renal effects may be also caused, more frequently in patients with a history of renal impairment treated with larger doses than recommended."
Gentamicin + Hydrocortisone Acetate,"Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside that binds to 30s and 50s ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria disrupting protein synthesis, thus rendering the bacterial cell membrane defective.Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Its anti-inflammatory action is due to the suppression of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It may also be used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical insufficiency.","Allergic contact dermatitis, Transient irritation, burning, stinging, Increased redness, lacrimation"
Gemifloxacin,"Gemifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It is bactericidal with minimum bactericidal concentrations. Gemifloxacin acts by inhibiting DNA synthesis through inhibition of the bacterial type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase, and/or topoisomerase IV (TOPO IV) which are both essential for bacterial growth.Gemifloxacin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It is widely distributed throughout the body. Studies in healthy subjects showed that gemifloxacin is distributed rapidly into target tissues and body fluids such as the lung (epithelial lining fluid, alveolar macrophages, bronchial tissue) and nasal secretions. Following oral administration of gemifloxacin, approximately 36% and 61% of the dose is excreted in the urine and feces, respectively, as unchanged drug and metabolites. AUC values were generally only slightly higher (approx. 10%) in women than in men. No dose adjustment is required based on gender","The general adverse events include abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, nausea, rash and vomiting. Some side effects have been infrequently reported such as fungal overgrowth in body, dizziness and insomnia, urticaria, pruritis and a maculopapular erythmatous skin rash."
Gemfibrozil,"Gemfibrozil is an anti-lipemic agent. Gemfibrozil decreases serum triglycerides in healthy individuals and patients with hyper-triglyceridemia. It decreases very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)- triglyceride concentration and to a lesser extent, LDL triglyceride concentration. HDL-triglyceride is usually decreased slightly. Gemfibrozil usually increases the HDL-cholesterol fraction in healthy individuals and patients with hyperlipoproteinemia, an action that may be beneficial in slowing the progression of atherosclerosis and in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease.Gemfibrozil also inhibits synthesis of VLDL carrier apolipoprotein B, leading to a decrease in VLDL production. How gemfibrozil raises HDL concentration is not known. Gemfibrozil inhibits lipolysis of fat in adipose tissue and decreases the hepatic uptake of plasma free fatty acids, thereby reducing hepatic triglyceride production.Gemfibrozil is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak concentration in plasma occurs within 1 to 2 hours; the half-life is about 1.5 hours. About 70% of a dose is excreted in the urine; little is excreted in the faeces.","The most frequent adverse effect involves the G. I. Tract. Abdominal pain and epigastric pain or dyspepsia is common adverse G. I. effects. Other adverse reaction includes pruritus, rash, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, painful extremities and rarely myalgia."
Gemcitabine,"Gemcitabine is a synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside and cytarabine analogue which is metabolised intracellularly to active diphosphate and triphosphate nucleosides. It inhibits DNA synthesis by inhibiting DNA polymerase and ribonucleotide reductase. It also induces apoptosis and is primarily active against cells in the S-phase, but may also arrest cells at the G1-S border.","Bone marrow suppression as manifested by leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia and myelosuppression. Mild GI effects; rashes; renal impairment, pulmonary toxicity, influenza-like symptoms; interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary oedema. Proteinuria, haematuria and haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Elevation of serum transaminase."
Gefitinib,"Gefitinib inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase by binding to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site of the enzyme. Thus the function of the EGFR tyrosine kinase in activating the Ras signal transduction cascade is inhibited; and malignant cells are inhibited. Gefitinib is the first selective inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase which is also referred to as Her1 or ErbB-1. EGFR is overexpressed in the cells of certain types of human carcinomas - for example in lung and breast cancers. Overexpression leads to inappropriate activation of the apoptotic Ras signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation.","Common side effects are pruritus, rash, angioedema, urticaria, epistaxis, haematuria, alopecia, dry mouth and skin, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, stomatitis, diarrhoea, nail disorders, asthenia, pyrexia, proteinuria, eye pain, corneal erosion or ulcer, aberrant eyelash growth and elevations in blood creatinine. Rarely, pancreatitis, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, corneal membrane sloughing, ocular ischemia, or ocular haemorrhage."
Gatifloxacin + Dexamethasone,"Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid which decreases inflammation by inhibiting the migration of leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It suppresses normal immune response.Gatifloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and Topoisomerase IV, the enzymes responsible for replication, transcription and repair of bacterial DNA.","Mild burning, chemosis, redness may occur."
Gatifloxacin (Oral),Gatifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial which acts by inhibiting DNA synthesis in susceptible organisms via inhibition of both DNA gyrase (essential for bacterial reproduction) and topoisomerase IV (essential during bacterial cell division).,"Gatifloxacin is generally well tolerated. The most common side effects that can occur while taking this drug are usually mild and include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, dizziness,and headache ."
Gatifloxacin (Ophthalmic),"The antibacterial action of gatifloxacin results from inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme that is involved in the replication, transcription and repair of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme known to play a key role in the partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division. The mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones including gatifloxacin is different from that of aminoglycoside, macrolide, and tetracycline antibiotics. Therefore, gatifloxacin may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics and these antibiotics may be active against pathogens that are resistant to gatifloxacin. There is no crossresistance between gatifloxacin and the aforementioned classes of antibiotics. Cross resistance has been observed between systemic gatifloxacin and some other fluoroquinolones. Resistance to gatifloxacin in vitro develops via multiple-step mutations.","The most frequently reported adverse events in the overall study population were conjunctival irritation, increased lacrimation etc."
Ganciclovir (Ophthalmic),"This eye gel contains the active ingredient, Ganciclovir, which is a guanosine derivative that, upon phosphorylation, inhibits DNA replication by herpes simplex viruses (HSV). Ganciclovir is transformed by viral and cellular thymidine kinases (TK) to ganciclovir triphosphate, which acts as an antiviral agent by inhibiting the synthesis of viral DNA in two ways: competitive inhibition of viral DNA-polymerase and direct incorporation into viral primer strand DNA, resulting in DNA chain termination and prevention of DNA replication.","Most common adverse reactions reported in patients were blurred vision (60%), eye irritation (20%), punctate keratitis (5%), and conjunctival hyperemia (5%)."
Gadoversetamide,"Gadoversetamide is a paramagnetic agent that develops a magnetic moment when placed in a magnetic field. The relatively large magnetic moment can enhance the relaxation rates of water protons in its vicinity, leading to an increase in signal intensity (brightness) of tissues.","Most common adverse reactions (incidence >2%) are: headache, vasodilatation, taste perversion, dizziness, nausea and paresthesia."
Gadodiamide,"The paramagnetic properties of Gadodiamide provides contrast enhancement during MRI. There were no clinically significant deviations from pre-injection values in haemodynamic and blood and urine laboratory parameters following intravenous injection of gadodiamide in healthy volunteers. However, a minor transient change in serum iron levels 8 to 48 hours after gadodiamide injection was observed.Gadodiamide does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier. Administration of Gadodiamide causes signal enhancement from areas where blood-brain barrier dysfunction has been induced by pathological processes, and may provide greater diagnostic yield than unenhanced MRI. Lack of enhancement need not indicate absence of pathology since some types of low grade malignancies or inactive MS-plaques fail to enhance; it can be used for differential diagnosis between different pathologies.","Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, Hypersensitivity reactions"
Gabapentin,"Gabapentin is an anti-convulsant. It is a structural analog of gamma-amino-butyric-acid (GABA). All pharmacological actions following administration of Gabapentin are due to the activity of parent compound. Gabapentin binds with the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage gated L-type Calcium channel, and inhibits branched chain amino acid transferase & probably inhibits neurotransmitter release of excitatory amino acid.","Fatigue, Dizziness, ataxia, weight gain, peripheral edema, dry mouth and somnolence may occur."
Fusidic acid + Hydrocortisone,"Fusidic Acid BP 2% & Hydrocortisone Acetate BP 1% combination cream contains the potent topical antibacterial action of Fusidic Acid with the anti-inflammatory & anti-pruritic effects of Hydrocortisone Acetate. When applied topically, Fusidic Acid is effective against Staphylococci, Streptococci, Corynebacteria, Neisseria and certain Clostridia & Bacteroides. Fusidic Acid is an antimicrobial agent that acts as an inhibitor of protein synthesis in the microorganism. It interferes with translocation step by stabilizing the ribosome-guanosine diphosphate elongation factor G-complex. This prevents binding of aminoacyl t-RNA to the ribosome and thereafter stops transfer of additional amino acids to the growing polypeptide. In humans, Hydrocortisone is the principal naturally occurring glucocorticosteroid. In pharmaceutical dosage, its main action is to reduce the response of the skin to injury (i.e. anti-in ammatory). It also has immuno suppressant & anti-mitotic actions.","Fusidic Acid has been reported to cause mild irritation at the application site, but did not usually require discontinuation of therapy. Reports of hypersensitivity reactions have been rare. Adverse effects are generally local and include: dryness, itching, burning, local irritation, striae, skin atrophy, atrophy of subcutaneous tissues, telangiectasia, hypertrichosis, change in pigmentation and secondary infection. If applied to the face, acne rosacea or perioral dermatitis can occur."
Fusidic acid + Betamethasone,"Fusidic acid is only effective against gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and Corynebacterium minutissimum. The antibacterial action of fusidic acid results from inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis. The drug interferes with amino acid transfer from aminoacyl-tRNA to protein on the ribosomes. Betamethasone induces lipocortin which inhibits phospholipase A-2 enzyme which results in the inhibition of different inflammartory mediators synthesis like prostaglandins, cinins, histamines.Pharmacokinetics: Fusidic acid can penetrate intact human skin. As much as 2% of the amount of topically applied fusidic acid penetrates intact skin. The degree of penetration depends on factors such as the duration of exposure to fusidic acid and the condition of the skin. Fusidic acid is excreted mainly in the bile with little excreted in the urine. Dermal absorption and potency of any topical corticosteroid including betamethasone depends on the vehicle in which the steroid is delivered. Absorption of betamethasone may be higher in certain body areas such as the face, groin, axilla, or on injured or inflamed skin such as the lesions of atopic dermatitis.","Possible side effects are allergic reactions, headache, skin rash, redness or itching, unusual tiredness or weakness, yellow eyes or skin."
Glycopyrronium Bromide (Oral solution),"Glycopyrrolate is a competitive inhibitor of acetylcholine receptors that are located on certain peripheral tissues, including salivary glands. Glycopyrrolate indirectly reduces the rate of salivation by preventing the stimulation of these receptors. Glycopyrrolate inhibits the action of acetylcholine on salivary glands thereby reducing the extent of salivation.","Gastrointestinal: Abdominal distention, abdominal pain, stomach discomfort, chapped lips, flatulence, retching, dry tongue

Vascular: Pallor"
Glycopyrronium Bromide (Injection),"Glycopyrronium bromide is a quaternary ammonium antimuscarinic with peripheral effects. It is used in anesthetic practice. Given as a premedication before general anesthesia, it diminishes the risk of vagal inhibition of the heart and reduces salivary and bronchial secretions. Intra-operatively, it may be given to reduce bradycardia and hypotension induced by drugs such as suxamethonium, halothane or propofol. Glycopyrronium bromide may be used before or with anticholinesterases such as neostigmine to prevent their muscarinic adverse effects. Antimuscarinic drugs are competitive inhibitors of the actions of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors of autonomic effector sites innervated by parasympathetic(cholinergic postganglionic) nerves, as well as being inhibitors of the action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle lacking cholinergic innervation. Peripheral antimuscarinic effects that are produced as the dose increases are: decreased production of secretions from the salivary, bronchial and sweat glands; dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) and paralysis of accommodation (cyclopegia); increased heart rate; inhibition of micturition and reduction in gastrointestinal tone; inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Quaternary ammonium compounds are sparingly lipid soluble and do not readily pass lipid membranes such as the blood brain barrier. Central effects are negligible.","Side effects of antimuscarinics such as glycopyrronium bromide are basically extensions of the fundamental pharmacological action. These include constipation, transient bradycardia (followed by tachycardia, palpitations and arrhythmias), reduced bronchial secretions, urinary urgency and retention, dilatation of the pupils with loss of accommodation, photophobia, dry mouth, flushing and dryness of the skin. Side effects that occur occasionally include confusion (particularly in the elderly), nausea, vomiting and giddiness. The following reported adverse reactions are extensions of glycopyrronium bromide’s fundamental pharmacological actions:

Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, bradycardia, palpitation and arrhythmia, hypertension, hypotension, cardiac arrest, heart block, prolonged QTc interval.
Dermatological: Flushing and inhibition of sweating, severe allergic reactions or drug idiosyncrasies including urticaria and other dermal manifestations, pruritus, dry skin.
Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, constipation, taste alterations, including loss of taste.
Genitourinary: Urinary hesitancy and retention, impotence.
Ocular: Blurred vision due to mydriasis, cycloplegia, photophobia, increased ocular tension.
Nervous System: Inhibition of transmission at neuromuscular junction, headache, nervousness, drowsiness, dizziness, seizure, insomnia, some degree of mental confusion, especially in the elderly, hyperexcitability in children.
Pregnancy and perinatal: Suppression of lactation.
Respiratory System: Respiratory arrest.
General: Hyperpyrexia bloated feeling, anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction, and hypersensitivity. Injection site reactions including pruritus, oedema, erythema, pain have been reported rarely."
Glycopyrronium Bromide (Inhalation capsule),"Glycopyrronium is a long-acting, specific antimuscarinic agent, in clinical medicine often called an anticholinergic. It has a similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, inhibition of M3-receptors at the smooth muscle results in relaxation. The high potency and slow receptor dissociation found its clinical correlate in significant and long-acting bronchodilation in patients with COPD.","Inhaled medicines may cause inhalation-induced bronchospasm, dehydration, dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, insomnia, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, immune system disorders."
Glycine,Glycine irrigation solution contains glycine which is an amino acid and a non-electrolyte. It is therefore non-conductive and suitable for irrigation purpose. Glycine Irrigation Solution minimizes the risk of intravascular haemolysis which can occur from absorption of plain water. Glycine Irrigation Solution is rapidly degraded in the liver by glycine oxidase.,"Large intravenous doses of glycine are known to cause nausea and salivation. Other consequences of systemic absorption of glycine include electrolyte loss, diuresis, edaema, thirst, dehydration, cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders."
Glycerol + Liquid Sugar,Glycerol is an osmotic dehydrating agent that possesses hygroscopic and lubricating properties. It causes plasma osmolality leading to the movement of water into the plasma from the extravascular spaces via osmosis.,This medicine is unlikely to cause side effects unless the patient is allergic to the ingredients.
Glycerol + Hypromellose + Polyethylene Glycol 400,"This eye drop is an almost colorless, clear aqueous lubricant sterile ocular solution administered to the eye(s). After topical application of this eye drop, it spreads rapidly over the conjunctiva and cornea forming a lubricating and protective film. Polyethylene Glycol 400 increases the stability of tear film and due to greater muco-adhesive properties hypromellose helps the tear film to attach with the ocular surface. Glycerin restores moisture to the dry eye. Electrolytes which are similar to the natural tears maintain good corneal epithelial surface.","Occasionally mild, transient burning or sticky sensation and very rarely irritation or hypersensitivity reactions reported. Blurred vision after application may occur."
Glycerin,"Glycerin is a hyperosmotic laxative, given rectally, which usually produces a bowel movement within 15 minutes to 1 hour. Hyperosmotic laxatives encourage bowel movements by drawing water into the bowel from surrounding tissues. This produces a softer stool mass and increases bowel action. These products are used for fast, predictable relief of occasional constipation.",When glycerin used rectally may cause rectal discomfort or a burning sensation.
Glucosamine Sulfate + Diacerein,"Glucosamine: Glucosamine (2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucose) is a natural amino sugar, produced by the body and found in certain foods. It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates, Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails and various other connective tissues. When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans.In humans, about 90 percent of glucosamine, administered as an oral dose of glucosamine sulfate, is absorbed from the digestive tract. Predominantly metabolized by liver & excreted through urine.Diacerein: This is used for the treatment of Osteoarthritis. It has also analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory activity. It release in vitro and directly inhibits InterLeukin-1(IL-1) synthesis, which is the main cytokine involved in cartilage destruction. Due to specific mode of action, it have been shown to have disease-modifying effect in experimental models of osteoarthritis and in human subjects with finger joint and knee osteoarthritis.Oral bioavailability of Diacerein 56%. Concurrent intake of food delays the time to peak concentration but associated with a 25% increase in absorption. Therefore, diacerein is best given with food. Mainly binds with protein albumin. Diacerein is metabolized extensively (100%) in liver following oral dosing. Urinary excretion of diacerein in the form of its metabolites has ranged between 35% and 60%.","No serious adverse effect has been reported. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, epigastria pain, headache, skin rashes & intense yellow coloring of urine may be occurred."
Glucosamine Sulfate + Chondroitin + Camphor + Peppermint oil,"Glucosamine is sugar protein that is believed to help in developing and renewing cartilage and keep it lubricated for better joint movement and flexibility.Chondroitin helps to maintain fluid and flexibility in the joints. The combination of chondroitin and glucosamine is widely used to aid in maintaining healthy joints. It is also used as a nutritional supplement in people with osteoarthritis or other inflammatory joint disorders.Camphor is a strong smelling compound, chemically manufactured from turpentine oil. When applied to the skin, it stimulates nerve endings to relieve pain, itching and to relieve osteoarthritis.Peppermint Oil is a strong smelling ingredient can be applied to the skin to treat muscle pain, nerve pain and joint pain.",There are no known systemic side effects unless people have an allergy or skin sensitivity to camphor or one of the inactive ingredients.
Glucosamine Sulfate + Chondroitin,"Glucosamine is a natural amino-sugar, produced by the body and found in certain foods.

Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans.Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans.Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance. It is also helpful during the repair phase of musculo-skeletal soft tissue injuries such as tendon or ligament strains","Safety studies with Glucosamine Sulfate & Chondroitin Sulfate show no demonstrable side effects. Rarely occurring side effects (such as, mild & reversible intestinal flatulence) are almost like placebo."
Glucosamine Hydrochloride,"Glucosamine is a naturally occurring compound for the body's production of joint lubricants and shock absorbers necessary to maintain healthy cartilage and joint function. Glucosamine hydrochloride is a prodrug for glucosamine that is well absorbed after oral administration and diffuses into several tissues, including bones and articular cartilages. The active ingredient in the treatment of osteoarthritis is glucosamine. The hydrochloride acid salt is the delivery vehicle. Once it has entered the stomach, after oral administration the salt's job is done and it is the glucosamine that is released to perform its function.Data supports Glucosamine as the first anti-osteoarthritic drug that treats both sign and symptoms of osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliances.",Safety studies with Glucosamine show no demonstrable toxicity. Rarely occurring side effects like mild & reversible intestinal flatulence are almost like placebo.
Glipizide + Metformin Hydrochloride,"Metformin is a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent, which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacological mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylurea, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patient with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia.Glipizide is a sulfonylurea which appears to lower blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs.","The most common side effects of Glipizide & Metformin are hypoglycemia,diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, musculoskeletal pain etc."
Glipizide,"Glipizide lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells. The extrapancreatic effects of Glipizide are increase in insulin sensitivity and decrease in hepatic glucose production.","The majority of side effects have been dose related, transient, and responded to dose reduction or withdrawal of the medication.Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal complaints were reported with the following approximate incidences like nausea, diarrhoea, constipation and gastralgia. They appear to be dose related and usually disappear on division or reduction of dosage. Cholestatic jaundice may occur rarely with these kind of drugs and Glipizide should be discontinued if this occurs.Dermatological: Allergic skin reactions including erythema, morbilliform or maculopapular eruption, urticaria, pruritus and eczema have been reported. They frequently disappear with continued therapy. However, if they persist, the drug should be discontinued.Haematologic: Leucopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, aplastic anaemia and pancytopenia have been reported with sulphonylureas.Metabolic: Hepatic porphyria and disulphiram like reactions have been reported with sulphonylurea.Endocrine reactions: Cases of hyponatraemia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion have been reported with this and other sulphonylureas.Miscellaneous: Dizziness, drowsiness and headache have been reported in patients treated with Glipizide. They are usually transient and seldom require discontinuation of therapy."
Glimepiride + Metformin,"Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent which decreases blood glucose concentration. The primary mechanism of action of Glimepiride appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells. Glimepiride acts in concert with glucose by improving the sensitivity of beta cells to physiological glucose stimulus, resulting in insulin secretion. In addition, extrapancreatic effects like reduction of basal hepatic glucose production, increased peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin and glucose uptake may also play role in the activity of Glimepiride. In non-fasting diabetic patients, the hypoglycaemic action of a single dose of Glimepiride persists for 24 hours.Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.","For Glimepiride:Metabolism and nutrition disorders-

As a result of the blood-glucose-lowering action of glimepiride, Hypoglycaemia which may also be prolonged.
The clinical picture of a severe hypoglycaemic attack may resemble that of a stroke.

Eye disorders: Especially at the start of treatment, there may be temporary visual impairment due to the change in blood glucose levels. The cause is a temporary alteration in the turgidity and hence the refractive index of the lens, this being dependent on blood glucose level.Gastrointestinal disorders-

Occasionally, Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sensations of pressure or fulness in the epigastrium, abdominal pain and diarrhea may occur.
In isolated cases, there may be hepatitis, elevation of liver enzyme levels and/or cholestasis and jaundice, which may progress to life-threatening liver failure.

Gliclazide,Gliclazide is a second generation sulfonylurea drug that has hypoglycaemic and potentially useful hematological properties. It stimulates the release of insulin from pancreatic β-cells by facilitating Ca+2  transport across the β-cell membranes and decreases hepatic glucose output.,"Like all medicines, Gliclazide can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most commonly observed side effect is low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). If left untreated these symptoms could progress to drowsiness, loss of consciousness or possibly coma. If an episode of low blood sugar is severe or prolonged, even if it is temporarily controlled by eating sugar, you should seek immediate medical attention.Liver disorders: There have been isolated reports of abnormal iiver function, which can cause yellow skin and eyes. If you get this, see your doctor immediately. The symptoms generally disappear if the medicine is stopped. Your doctor will decide whether to stop your treatment.Skin disorders: Skin reactions such as rash, redness, itching, hives, blisters, angioedema (rapid swelling of tissues such as eyelids, face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat that may result in breathing difficulty) have been reported. Rash may progress to widespread blistering or peeling of the skin. If you develop this, stop taking, seek urgent advice from a doctor and tell him that you are taking this medicine. Exceptionally, signs of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported: initially as flu-like symptoms and a rash on the face then an extended rash with a high temperature.Blood disorders: Decrease in the number of cells in the blood (e.g. platelets, red and white blood cells) which may cause paleness, prolonged bleeding, bruising, sore throat and fever have been reported. These symptoms usually vanish when the treatment is discontinued.Digestive disorders: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, diarrhoea, and constipation. These effects are reduced when Gliclazide is taken with a meal as recommended.Eye disorders: Your vision may be affected for a short time especially at the start of treatment. This effect is due to changes in blood sugar levels. As for another sulfonylurea, the following adverse events have been observed: cases of severe changes in the number of blood cells and allergic inflammation of the wall of blood vessels, reduction in blood sodium (hyponatraemia), symptoms of liver impairment (for instance jaundice) which in most cases disappeared after withdrawal of the sulfonylurea, but may lead to life-threatening liver failure in isolated cases.Reporting of side effects: If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine."
Hepatitis A Vaccine,"The hepatitis A virus belongs to the picornavirus family. It is one of several hepatitis viruses that cause systemic disease with pathology in the liver. The incubation period for hepatitis A averages 28 days (range: 15 to 50 days). The course of hepatitis A infection is extremely variable, ranging from asymptomatic infection to icteric hepatitis and death. The presence of antibodies to HAV confers protection against hepatitis A infection. However, the lowest titer needed to confer protection has not been determined.","Transient soreness, erythema, induration at inj site. Fever, malaise,"
Heparin Sodium,"Heparin inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo. Heparin acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system. Small amounts of heparin in combination with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor) can inhibit thrombosis by inactivating activated Factor X and inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Once active thrombosis has developed, larger amounts of heparin can inhibit further coagulation by inactivating thrombin and preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot in inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor.Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin. Clotting time is prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin.","Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. chills, fever, urticaria, asthma, rhinitis); painful, ischaemic and cyanosed limbs; osteoporosis (in long-term admin), suppression of aldosterone synthesis leading to hyperkalaemia, cutaneous necrosis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, rebound hyperlipaemia; increased serum concentrations of AST and ALT, prolonged prothrombin time; local irritation, erythema, mild pain, haematoma or ulceration on inj site."
Halothane,"When inhaled, Halothane is absorbed through the alveoli into the bloodstream. In the bloodstream, Halothane circulates through the body to the principal site of action, the brain. Here Halothane causes a progressive depression of the central nervous system, beginning with the higher centers (cerebral cortex) and spreading to the vital centers in the medulla. This depression is reversible. However, its mode of action, like all anaesthetic agents, is unknown.Halothane has a relatively low solubility in blood and therefore alveoli/blood concentrations equilibrate rapidly. The triexponential decline in Halothane blood concentrations following the end of administration is thought to represent distribution into three compartments; the vessel rich group (brain/heart/liver), the musculature and adipose tissue. Approximately 80% of the inhaled Halothane is eliminated unchanged by the lungs. The remaining 20% is metabolized in the liver by oxidative and under hypoxic conditions, reductive pathways. The main metabolites are trifluoroacetic acid, bromide and chloride salts (via the oxidative pathway) and fluoride salts (via the reductive pathway). The concentrations of metabolites peak 24 hours post-operatively and are eliminated by renal excretion during the following week.","Post-op nausea, vomiting, and shivering; resp depression, hypotension, skeletal muscle relaxation, bradycardia."
Haloperidol,"Haloperidol is a butyropherone derivative with antipsychotic properties that has been considered particularly effective in the management of hyperactivity, agitation and mania. Haloperidol is an effective neuroleptic and also possesses antiemetic properties. It may also exhibit hypothermic and anorexiant effects and potentiate the action of barbiturates, general anesthetics and other CNS depressant drugs. Haloperidol is a quick acting substance and has a duration of action of about 12 hours after one single administration. The optimum daily therapy consists of 2 administrations.","Haloperidol is a safe neuroleptic. Headache, vertigo, insomnia are the more common side effects encountered. Drowsiness, lethargy, stupor, confusion, restlessness, agitation, anxiety, euphoria and exacerbation of psychotic symptoms including hallucinations also may occur. Dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea and hypersalivation have also been reported."
Halobetasol Propionate + Tazarotene,"Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action in plaque psoriasis is unknown. Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is convert d to its active form, tazarotenic acid, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RARα, RARβ and RARγ, but shows relative selectivity for RARβ, and RARγ and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings for the treatment of plaque psoriasis is unknown.A vasoconstrictor assay in healthy subjects with this lotion indicated that it is in the high to super-high range of potency as compared to other topical corticosteroids; however, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. The potential for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression was evaluated in a study in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. A median dose of 8.2 grams this lotion was applied once daily for 8 weeks and 20 subjects were assessed for HPA axis suppression at Weeks 4 and 8. HPA axis suppression was observed in 3 out of 20 (15%) subjects at Week 4. None of the 20 (0%) subjects had HPA axis suppression at Week 8. In this study, the criteria for HPA axis suppression was a serum cortisol level of less than or equal to 18 micrograms per deciliter 30 minutes after stimulation with cosyntropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone).","The most common side effects are redness, itching, swelling, burning, stinging, application site pain, inflamed hair follicles (folliculitis), thinning of the skin (atrophy), peeling and rash."
Halobetasol Propionate,"Like other topical corticosteroids, halobetasol propionate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 .","The following adverse effects have been reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids. These reactions include burning, itching, dryness, folliculitis acne, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, skin atrophy, secondary infections, striae and miliaria."
Halcinonide,"The precise mechanism of action of topical corticosteroids is unclear. However they possess anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. New research indicates that halcinonide activates MBP (myelin basic protein) expression via smoothened receptor activation. This finding suggests that halcinonide could be used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis therapy as an alternative to Dexamethasone or Methylprednisolone.","Prolonged application causes epidermal thinning, contact dermatitis, perioral dermatitis, papular disorder, mild depigmentation; telangiectasia, striae (especially face and flexures). Application on eyelids and surrounding skin can raise intraocular pressure, cataracts, glaucoma, corneal ulcers and raised intracranial pressure. Systemic absorption with adrenal suppression may be seen when applied to large areas, when skin is broken or under occlusive dressing."
Haemophilus Influenzae Type B Vaccine [Conjugated],"Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria are surrounded by polysaccharide capsules, which make the bacteria resistant to attack by white blood cells. However, human blood serum contains antibodies, which render the bacteria vulnerable to attack. The vaccine, which is composed of the purified polysaccharide from Hib bacterial cells, stimulates production of anticapsular antibodies and provides active immunity to the Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria represented by the polysaccharide in the vaccine.Haemophilus b polysaccharide vaccine, unlike the conjugate vaccine, predominantly stimulates B-cells to produce antibodies. This is known as being T-cell independent and is characteristic of polysaccharide vaccines. The initial stimulation of T-cells followed by stimulation of B cells (known as a T-cell response) is particularly important in young children to ensure adequate and persisting antibody production. Stimulation of T-cells also results in an anamnestic response to future doses of the vaccine and future natural exposure to Haemophilus influenzae type b. The poor T-cell response stimulated by the polysaccharide vaccine is thought to be one reason why the polysaccharide vaccine is not adequately immunogenic in children up to 18 months of age and may not be fully immunogenic in children 18 to 24 months of age. In addition, lack of initial T-cell stimulation probably is the reason that repeat doses of the polysaccharide vaccine do not boost the antibody response consistently.","Very common adverse reactions are tenderness, erythema, induration, unusual crying, irritability, vomiting, diarrhoea, change in eating habits, sleepiness, fever."
Guaifenesin + Levomenthol + Diphenhydramine,"Guaifenesin is reported to reduce the viscosity of tenacious sputum end is used as an expectorant. Levomenthol has mild local anesthetic and decongestant properties. Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride possesses antitussive, antihistaminic, and anticholinergic properties.","This syrup may cause drowsiness, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, gastro-intestinal disturbance, dry mouth, nose and throat difficulty in urination or blurred vision."
Guaifenesin + Dextromethorphan + Menthol,"Guaifenesin is an expectorant. It helps loosen congestion in the chest and throat, making it easier to cough out through the mouth.Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide is a cough suppressant. It affects the signals in the brain that trigger cough reflex.Menthol is an organic compound made synthetically or obtained from corn mint, peppermint, or other mint oils. It has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it is widely used to relieve minor throat irritation.","Common side effects may include:

Dizziness, drowsiness;
Gastrointestinal disturbance
Feeling nervous, restless, anxious, or irritable

Do not use for children less than 12 years of age."
Griseofulvin [Microsize],"Griseofulvin is fungistatic, however the exact mechanism by which it inhibits the growth of dermatophytes is not clear. It is thought to inhibit fungal cell mitosis and nuclear acid synthesis. It also binds to and interferes with the function of spindle and cytoplasmic microtubules by binding to alpha and beta tubulin. It binds to keratin in human cells, then once it reaches the fungal site of action, it binds to fungal microtubes thus altering the fungal process of mitosis.","When adverse reactions occur, they are most commonly of the hypersensitivity type such as skin rashes, urticaria and rarely, angioneurotic edema or erythemamultiforme-like drug reaction, and may necessitate withdrawal of therapy and appropriate countermeasures. Paresthesias of the hands and feet have been reported rarely after extended therapy. Other side effects reported occasionally are oral thrush, nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, dizziness, insomnia, mental confusion and impairment of performance of routine activities.Proteinuria and leukopenia have been reported rarely. Administration of the drug should be discontinued if granulocytopenia occurs. When rare, serious reactions occur with griseofulvin, they are usually associated with high dosages, long periods of therapy, or both."
Granisetron,"Granisetron is a highly selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors. It blocks serotonin peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone.Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. During chemotherapy that induces vomiting, mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin, which stimulates 5-HT3 receptors. This evokes vagal afferent discharge, inducing vomiting. Animal studies demonstrate that, in binding to 5-HT3 receptors, granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin. In the ferret animal model, a single granisetron injection prevented vomiting due to high-dose cisplatin or arrested vomiting within 5 to 30 seconds.In most human studies, granisetron has had little effect on blood pressure, heart rate or ECG. No evidence of an effect on plasma prolactin or aldosterone concentrations has been found in other studies.","Headache, insomnia, constipation, diarrhoea, elevated hepatic transaminases; QT prolongation; bradycardia, palpitations, sick sinus syndrome, chest pain. Application site reactions (transdermal): Rash, pain, erythema, pruritus, irritation, burn, vesicles, urticaria, discolouration; patch non-adhesion."
Gramacidin + Neomycin + Polymixin B,Neomycin is bactericidal for many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. It is an aminoglycoside antibiotic which inhibits protein synthesis by binding with ribosomal RNA and causing misreading of the bacterial genetic code.Polymyxin B is bactericidal for a variety of gram-negative organisms. It increases the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane by interacting with the phospholipid components of the membrane.Gramicidin is bactericidal for a variety of gram-positive organisms. It increases the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane to inorganic cations by forming a network of channels through the normal lipid bilayer of the membrane.,"Adverse reactions have occurred with the anti-infective components of this product. The exact incidence is not known. Reactions occurring most often are allergic reactions including itching, swelling, and conjunctival erythema . More serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported rarely. Local irritation on instillation has also been reported."
Golimumab,"Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to both the soluble and transmembrane bioactive forms of human TNFα. This interaction prevents the binding of TNFα to its receptors, thereby inhibiting the biological activity of TNFα (a cytokine protein). There was no evidence of the golimumab antibody binding to other TNF superfamily ligands; in particular, the golimumab antibody did not bind or neutralize human lymphotoxin. Golimumab did not lyse human monocytes expressing transmembrane TNF in the presence of complement or effector cells.Elevated TNFα levels in the blood, synovium, and joints have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. TNFα is an important mediator of the articular inflammation that is characteristic of these diseases. The exact mechanism by which golimumab treats ulcerative colitis is unknown. Golimumab modulated the in vitro biological effects mediated by TNF in several bioassays, including the expression of adhesion proteins responsible for leukocyte infiltration (E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and GM-CSF).","Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 5%) are upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, injection site reactions"
Glycopyrronium Bromide + Formoterol Fumarate,"This preparation contains two bronchodilators: Glycopyrronium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and Formoterol is a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) with a rapid onset of action. Glycopyrronium has similar afnity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological efects through inhibition of the M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. Formoterol causes direct relaxation of airway smooth muscle as a consequence of the increase in cyclic AMP through activation of adenylyl cyclase.","The most common adverse reactions include cough and urinary tract infection. Possible side efects are sudden breathing problems, headache, tremor, nervousness, rash, swelling of the face, mouth and tongue, hives, increase blood pressure, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, muscle spasm, muscle weakness, eye pain or discomfort and urinary retention."

wheezing,
upper respiratory tract infection,
runny nose,
fatigue."
Hydrogen peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidising agent with antibacterial and antiviral activity. It is used as an antiseptic, disinfectant, and deodorant. It also has a mild haemostatic action. It exerts its antiseptic action partly by its ready release of oxygen when applied to tissues, but this effect is reduced in the presence of organic matter. The mechanical effect of effervescence may be more useful for wound cleansing than the antimicrobial action.","Irritating burns on the skin and mucous membranes (strong solutions); reversible hypertrophy of the papillae of the tongue with continued use as mouthwash; gas embolism, rupture of the colon, proctitis, ulcerative colitis and gangrene of the intestines have occurred following colonic lavage with hydrogen peroxide solution."

Hydrocortisone Acetate + Neomycin Sulphate,"Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Its anti-inflammatory action is due to the suppression of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It may also be used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical insufficiency.Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It binds to 30S ribosomal subunits of bacterial ribosome thus inhibiting protein synthesis and generating errors in genetic code transcription causing cell death. It acts against many gram-negative aerobes and some gram-positive aerobes. It lacks activity against fungi, viruses and most anaerobic bacteria","Burning, itching, irritation, hypopigmentaion, skin atrophy, striae."
Hydrocortisone Acetate + Benzyl Benzoate + Bismuth Subgallate + Bismuth Oxide + Balsam Peru + Zinc Oxide,"This ointment provides antiseptic, astringent, emollient and anti-inflammatory actions. Bismuth oxide, zinc oxide, and bismuth subgallate exert a protective action on mucous membranes They are mildly astringent and are reported to have antiseptic properties Balsam Peru has protective properties and a very mild antiseptic action by virtue of its content of cinnamic and benzoic acids. It is believed to promote the growth of epithelial cells, Benzyl benzoate is used as a solubilizing agent and has mild antiseptic and preservative properties. Hydrocortisone acetate has anti-inflammatory action.","Prolonged or excessive use may produce systemic corticosteroid effects, and use for periods longer than seven days is not recommended. Rarely, there are sensitivity reactions and Patients may occasionally experience transient burning on application especially if the anoderm is not intact."
Hydrocortisone Acetate,"Hydrocortisone binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.","Hydrocortisone Acetate 1% cream is usually well-tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped."
Hydrocortisone + Neomycin Sulphate + Polymixin B,"Polymyxin B sulphate and neomycin sulphate belong to a group of medicines called antibiotics. They kill the germs that can cause ear infections. The anti-infective components in the combination are included to provide action against specific organisms susceptible to them. Neomycin sulfate and polymyxin B sulfate together are considered active against the following microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella-Enterobacter species, Neisseria species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This product does not provide adequate coverage against Serratia marcescens and streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae.Hydrocortisone belongs to a group of medicines called steroids. It helps to reduce the swelling and irritation caused by the infection. Hydrocortisone suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they may delay healing. Since Hydrocortisone may inhibit the body’s defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant in a particular case.","The following side effects rarely may happen with this medicine: seem to get worse instead of better, become red, scaly and itchy."
Hydrocortisone + Lidocaine,"Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Its anti-inflammatory action is due to the suppression of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It may also be used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical insufficiency.Lidocaine is an amide type local anesthesia. It stabilises the neuronal membrane and inhibits Na ion movements, which are necessary for conduction of impulses. In the heart, lidocaine reduces depolarisation of the ventricles during diastole and automaticity in the His-Purkinje system. Duration of action potential and effective refractory period are also reduced.","Side effects like Rectal bleeding, Swelling of the skin, Adrenal suppression, Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, Cushing syndrome, Hirsutism, Acne, Cutaneous and subcutaneous atrophy, Dry scaly skin, Urticaria."
Hydrocortisone,Hydrocortisone inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme phospholipase A2. Hydrocortisone reduces various vasoactive agents released during inflammation. It also controls the rate of protein synthesis.,"Hydrocortisone is generally well tolerated except in prolonged high doses. It may cause cardiac arrhythmia, esophageal candidiasis, menstrual irregularity, decreased carbohydrate & glucose tolerance, fluid retention, increased appetite, weight gain, euphoria, mood swings, depression, insomnia, acne etc."
Hydrochlorothiazide + Triamterene,"Triamterene directly inhibits the exchange of Na for K and hydrogen in the distal renal tubule. Hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of Na and Cl ions, and consequently of water, by reducing electrolyte reabsorption from the renal tubules.Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of anangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.","Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness, weakness, hypotension, headache, muscle cramps, dry mouth, thirst, anaphylaxis, rash, metabolic acidosis, pancreatitis. Rarely, SLE and photosensitivity."
Hydrochlorothiazide,"Thiazides such as hydrochlorothiazide promote water loss from the body (diuretics). They inhibit Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.","Gastro-intestinal system: Anorexia, gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhoea, constipation, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), pancreatitis, salivary gland inflammation. Central nervous system: Dizziness, vertigo, paraesthesiae, headache, yellow vision.Heamatological: Leucopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anaemia, haemolytic anaemia.Cardiovascular: Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension.Hypersensitivity: Purpura, photosensitivity, rash, urticaria, necrotising angiitis (vasculitis, cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratiory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema, anaphylactic reactions, toxic epidermal necrolysis.Metabolic: Hyperglycaemia, glycosuria, hyperuricaema, electrolyte imbalance including hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia.Renal: Renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis, renal failure.Other: Muscle spasm, weakness, restlessness, transient blurred vision, impotence. Whenever side-effects are moderate to severe, thiazide dosage should be reduced or therapy was withdrawn."
Hyaluronic Acid,"Hyaluronic Acid (HA) is a natural organic compound synthesized by fibroblasts and is composed of repeating disaccharide units formed by Glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine acid. The main function of HA, in most biological processes, is to maintain the structural and functional characteristics of tissues. The biosynthesis of HA decreases with age and traumas. Boswellia (containing AKBA at 10%) is useful for the joint function.This tablet has patented triple-coating technology with two different molecular weights of Hyaluronic acid. The purpose of the different molecular weight is to allow the higher molecular weight to be broken down by the stomach acids and the lower molecular weight to be absorbed through the synovial fluids so to ensures the ingredients will reach the joints unchanged and will not break into the stomach by the acids that are there.This is made from Hyaluronic acid extracted from Fermented vegetables which is a 100% Vegetarian product.

But if you have any specific allergies, we recommend you to consult with your doctor before taking this supplement."
Human Tetanus Immunoglobulin,"Human clostridium tetani toxoid immune globulin prevents tetanus toxoid from damaging tissue and producing the symptoms associated with tetanus. The immune globulin binds to tetanus toxiod, interfering with the normal interaction of the toxoid with human tissue. This prevents the toxoid from invading the nervous system and producing painful muscle spasms as well as autonomic dysfunction. The Clostridium tetani bacterium is killed either via antibiotic treatment of the host's immune system and immune globulin-bound toxoid is likely broken down by phagocytic immune cells.","Adverse reaction following administration of human tetanus immunoglobulin is infrequent and mild, but severe local and systemic reactions have occurred rarely.

Local reactions at the injection site: Local pain, tenderness or swelling.

In rare cases the following adverse reactions may occur:

Immune system disorders: Allergic reactions including fall in blood pressure, dyspnoea, cutaneous reactions, in isolated cases reaching as far as anaphylactic shock, even when the patient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous administration of immunoglobulins.

"Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18)","HPV only infects human beings. Animal studies with analogous animal papillomaviruses suggest that the efficacy of L1 VLP vaccines may involve the development of humoral immune responses. Human beings develop a humoral immune response to the vaccine, although the exact mechanism of protection is unknown.","The most common adverse reaction was headache. Common adverse reactions (frequency of at least 1.0% and greater than AAHS control or saline placebo) are fever, nausea, dizziness; and injection-site pain, swelling, erythema, pruritus, and bruising."
Human Papillomavirus Bivalent (Types 16 & 18),"Human Papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 and 18 cause about 70% of cervical cancer. HPV bivalent (types 16 and 18) vaccine is a non-infectious vaccine produced by recombinant technology, which contains virus-like particles (VLP) of the major capsid LI protein of oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18. Efficacy of vaccine may be mediated by the production of IgG neutralizing antibodies against the HPV-L1 capsid proteins.","Injection site pain, erythema, and inflammation Fatigue, Headache, Myalgia, GI symptoms, Arthralgia"
Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin,"Pharmacodynamic Properties: Highly Purified Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin has LH activity. LH is indispensable in normal female and male gamete growth and maturation, and gonadal steroid production.

In the female: Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin is given as a substitute for the endogenous mid-cycle LH surge to induce the final phase of follicular maturation, leading to ovulation. Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin  is also given as a substitute for endogenous LH during the luteal phase.
In the male: Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin is given to stimulate Leydig cells to promote the production of testosterone.

Pharmacokinetic Properties: Maximal Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin  plasma levels will be reached approximately six hours after a single injection of Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin . Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin  is for approximately 80 percent metabolized, predominantly in the kidneys. Following intramuscular injection (IM) the apparent elimination half-life of Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin  is about 2 days. On basis of the recommended dose regimens and elimination half-life, accumulation does not occur.","Allergic reactions have occasionally been reported with the use of urinary gonadotrophin preparations. These mostly involve local reactions such as pain and rash at the injection site, and generalized reactions such as rash and fever.In the female: Unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Which is Characteristic symptoms of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation and the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome are  included under 'Special warnings and special precautions for use'.In the Male: Water and sodium retention is occasionally seen after administration of high dosages; this is regarded as a result of excessive androgen production. Treatment with Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin  leads to increased androgen production.Therefore: Patients with latent or overt cardiac failure, renal dysfunction, hypertension, epilepsy or migraine (or a history of these conditions) should be kept under close medical supervision, since aggravation or recurrence may occasionally be induced as a result of increased androgen production. Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin should be used cautiously in prepubertal boys to avoid premature epiphyseal closure or precocious sexual development. Skeletal maturation should be monitored regularly."
Human Anti-D Immunoglobulins,"Anti-D immunoglobulin prevents a rhesus-negative mother from actively forming antibodies to foetal rhesus-positive RBCs that may pass into the maternal circulation during childbirth, abortion, or certain other sensitising events. It is also used in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura to prevent excessive bleeding.","Hypersensitivity reactions such as hives, wheezing, urticaria, Pain and tenderness at inj site. Fever, chills, nausea, facial flushing, headache."
Homatropine Hydrobromide,"Homatropine, a tertiary amine antimuscarinic, produces dilation and loss of accommodation by blocking the response of iris sphincter muscle and the accommodative ciliary muscle to cholinergic stimulation.",Hypersensitivity may occur as conjunctivitis.
Ibuprofen,"Ibuprofen has a high level of anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, and analgesic activity. The analgesic effects of Ibuprofen are due to both a peripheral and a central effect. Ibuprofen is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which thus results in a marked reduction in prostaglandin synthesis. Ibuprofen also inhibits the synthesis of some lipo-oxygenase products. Ibuprofen thus quickly relieves pain and stiffness, reduces swelling, and improves the movement of different joints of arthritis sufferers.","Upset stomach, vomiting, heartburn, nausea may occur."
Ibrutinib,"Ibrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of BTK. Ibrutinib forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity. BTK is a signaling molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. BTK’s role in signaling through the B-cell surface receptors results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Nonclinical studies show that ibrutinib inhibits malignant B-cell proliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell migration and substrate adhesion in vitro.","The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Hemorrhage, Infections, Cytopenias, Atrial Fibrillation, Hypertension, Second Primary Malignancies and Tumor Lysis Syndrome. Additional Important Adverse Reactions: Diarrhea, Visual Disturbance."
Ibandronic Acid + Calcium Carbonate + Vitamin D3,"Ibandronic Acid (Ibandronate Sodium Monohydrate) is a nitrogen- containing bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The action of Ibandronate on bone tissue is based on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone. Ibandronate inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass.The combination of Coral Calcium and Colecalciferol is composed of Calcium Carbonate with small amounts of Magnesium and other Trace minerals. Coral Calcium ensures better absorption than Calcium of other Calcium Carbonate origin due to its chemical structure that is very similar to the composition of human bone Calcium Carbonate. Vitamin-D aids in the absorption of Calcium from GI tract and helps to maintain Calcium balance in the body.","Ibandronic Acid: Common side effects include Hypertension, Dyspepsia, Nausea, Diarrhea, Abdominal Pain, Arthralgia, Back Pain, Localized Osteoarthritis, Myalgia, Muscle Cramp, Influenza, Nasopharyngitis, Bronchitis, Urinary Tract Infection, Upper Respiratory Tract Infection, Headache, Dizziness, Skin rash, Insomnia etc. Calcium & Vitamin D3: Most common side effects are flatulence, diarrhea, constipation, upper GI discomfort etc. Hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia due to prolong use has rarely been reported."
Ibandronic Acid,"The pharmacodynamic action of ibandronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption. In vivo, ibandronic acid prevents experimentally induced bone destruction caused by cessation of gonadal function, retinoids, tumors or tumor extracts. In young (fast growing) rats, the endogenous bone resorption is also inhibited, leading to increased bone mass compared with untreated animals. Animal models confirm that ibandronic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of osteoclastic activity. In growing rats, there was no evidence of impaired mineralization even at doses greater than 5,000 times the dose required for osteoporosis treatment. The high potency and therapeutic margin of ibandronic acid allows for more flexible dosing regimens and intermittent treatment with long drug-free intervals at comparatively low doses.Ibandronic acid is a highly potent bisphosphonate belonging to the nitrogen-containing group of bisphosphonates, which act on bone tissue and specifically inhibit osteoclast activity, It does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment. The selective action of ibandronic acid on bone tissue is based on the high affinity of this compound for hydroxyapatite, which represents the mineral matrix of the bone. Ibandronic acid reduces bone resorption, with no direct effect on bone formation. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover towards premenopausal levels, leading to a progressive net gain in bone mass. Daily or intermittent administration of ibandronic acid results in reduced bone resorption as reflected in reduced levels of serum and urinary biochemical markers of bone turnover, increased BMD and a decreased incidence of fractures.","The main side effects of ibandronic acid are dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, headaches, dizziness."
Hypromellose + Carbomer,"This eye for all patients with ocular discomfort. The slight hypotonicity of the gel is rapidly ""neutralised"" by the slightly hypertonic tear fluid caused by dry eyes.","This Gel is very well tolerated by users. However, some cases of burning, stinging, allergic reactions or red eyes after instillation have been reported. Transient blurring of vision after administration has also been reported."
Hypromellose,"Hypromellose is a semisynthetic, inert and viscoelastic polymer used as an ophthalmic lubricant. Hypromellose acts as a lubricant and artificial tear in the symptomatic treatment of dehydration of the cornea and conjunctiva due to impaired lacrimal secretion and functional disorders as a result of topical or systemic diseases, or caused by deficient or incomplete eyelid closure.","Common side effects are brief blurred vision or a slight stinging sensation on instilling Hypromellose. Hypromellose enriched with Carbomer 980 is very well tolerated by users. However, some cases of burning, stinging, allergic reactions or red eyes after instillation have been reported. Transient blurring of vision after administration has also been reported."
Hyoscine Hydrobromide,Hyoscine Hydrobromide is a type of medicine called an antimuscarinic (or anticholinergic). Hyoscine hydrobromide is sometimes known as scopolamine. It is thought to prevent motion sickness by stopping the messages sent from the vestibular system to reach an area of the brain called the vomiting centre. This area of the brain coordinates the vomiting reflex.,"Dry mouth, dizziness, blurred vision, difficulty with micturition."
Hylan G-F 20,"Joints contain a fluid, called synovial fluid, which acts as a lubricant and shock absorber. Patients with osteoarthritis have synovial fluid that is thinner than normal, and, therefore, it is less effective as a lubricant and shock-absorber. Hylan G-F 20 is an elastic fluid that is made from a substance called hyaluronan, that is found in normal joint fluid. Hyaluronan is the key substance in joint fluid that provides the shock-absorbing quality to the fluid, and it is essential for the proper functioning of joints. When Hylan G-F 20 is injected into the knee of a patient with osteoarthritis, the drug helps to restore the shock-absorbing effect of the fluid within the knee. This can reduce pain, resulting in a more active lifestyle.","The most commonly reported adverse events associated with Hylan G-F 20 are the following: Pain in the injected knee, Swelling in the injected knee, Joint effusion"
Hydroxyzine  Hydrochloride,"Hydroxyzine Hydrochloride is an anxiolytic antihistamine of the piperazine class which is a H1 receptor antagonist. Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system. Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally. Bronchodilator activity and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated. Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.","Side effects reported with the administration of Hydroxyzine Hhydrochloride are usually mild and transitory in nature. More common side effects include drowsiness, headache, psychomotor impairment, and antimuscarinic effects such as urinary retention, dry mouth, blurred vision, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Other rare side-effects of antihistamines include hypotension, palpitation, arrhythmias, extrapyramidal effects, dizziness, confusion, depression, sleep disturbances, tremor, convulsions, hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, rashes, and photosensitivity reactions), blood disorders, liver dysfunction, and angle-closure glaucoma."
Hydroxyurea,"Hydroxyurea is converted to a free radical nitroxide (NO) in vivo, and transported by diffusion into cells where it quenches the tyrosyl free radical at the active site of the M2 protein subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, inactivating the enzyme. The entire replicase complex, including ribonucleotide reductase, is inactivated and DNA synthesis is selectively inhibited, producing cell death in S phase and synchronization of the fraction of cells that survive. Repair of DNA damaged by chemicals or irradiation is also inhibited by hydroxyurea, offering potential synergy between hydroxyurea and radiation or alkylating agents. Hydroxyurea also increases the level of fetal hemoglobin, leading to a reduction in the incidence of vasoocclusive crises in sickle cell anemia. Levels of fetal hemoglobin increase in response to activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) by hydroxyurea-derived NO.","Gl disturbances, Nausea, Vomiting, Constipation, Diarrhea, Hyperuricemia, Renal failure, Rash, Hyperpigmentation. Pulmonary oedema, dermatological reactions, headache, dizziness. Disorientation, drowsiness, hallucinations, convulsions, alopecia."
Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose,"Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose is a non pyrogenic viscoelastic solution that occupies space and protects tissue. When used in anterior segment surgeries, it allows for more efficient manipulation with less trauma to the ocular tissues, such as the corneal endothelium, by maintaining a deep chamber. The viscoelastic properties of Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose facilitate pushing back the vitreous face, which prevents the formation of a postoperative flat chamber.","Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose has been extremely well tolerated after injection into the human eye. A transient rise in intraocular pressure postoperatively has been reported in some cases. Rarely, postoperative inflammatory reactions (iritis, hypopyon), as well as incidents of corneal edema and corneal decompensation, have been reported with viscoelastic agents."
Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate,"The mechanism by which progesterone prevents preterm birth is not well understood, but many pathways are likely involved. (1) Progesterone plays a vital role in regulation of the female reproductive system and is important for successful implantation of the embryo and maintenance of pregnancy. It acts by binding to progesterone receptors in the uterus, ovaries, breasts and in the central nervous system. These receptors exist in 2 isoforms, PR-A and PR-B. Progesterone binding to these receptors ultimately leads to regulation of gene transcription. (2) This results in an anti-inflammatory effect which blunts the proinflammatory state that occurs with initiation of labor, and maintains uterine queiscence by stabilizing progesterone acting on the myometrium.","Most Common: Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, pruritus, nodule), Hives, Itching, nausea, and diarrhea. Call your doctor if you get any of the symptoms below:

Blood clots Symptoms: Leg swelling, Redness in your leg, a spot on your leg that is warm to touch, Leg pain that worsens when you bend your foot.
Allergic reactions: Hives, Itching, Swelling of the face."
Hydroxychloroquine Sulphate,"Hydroxychloroquine Sulphate synthetically produced version of quinine. It acts as an immunosuppressant by inhibiting production of rheumatoid and acute phase reactants. It also accumulates in white blood cells, stabilizing lysosomal membranes and inhibiting the activity of many enzymes, including collagenase and the proteases that cause cartilage breakdown. It also acts by disrupting cell walls of infected red blood cells and kills the developing parasites.","Generally Hydroxychloroquine Sulphate is well tolerated. However, few side effects like nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, loss of appetite, diarrhea, tiredness, weakness or headache and visual problem may occur the first several days."
Hydroxocobalamin,Vitamin B12 with hydroxyl group complexed to cobalt which can be displaced by cyanide resulting in cyanocobaiamin that is renally excreted.,"Mild transient diarrhea, itching, transitory exanthema, feeling of swelling of entire body, and anaphylaxis. A few patients may experience pain after injection of hydroxocobalamin."
Hydroquinone + Octyldimethyl + Dioxybenzone + Oxybenzone,"Hydroquinone is a topical depigmentating agent used in hyperpigmentation conditions by suppressing melanocyte metabolic processes. It also increases melanin excretion from melanocytes and prevents its production.Octyldimethyl P-aminobenzoate is used topically as a sunscreen. It is used to prevent sunburn, but unlikely to prevent drug-related or other photosensitivity reactions associated with UVA light.Dioxybenzone (benzophenone-8) is an organic compound used in sunscreen to block UVB and short-wave UVA (ultraviolet) rays. It is a derivative of benzophenone. It is a yellow powder with a melting point of 68 °C. It is insoluble in water, but moderately soluble in ethanol and isopropanol.Oxybenzone: Although benzophenones are primarily UV-B absorbers, oxybenzone absorbs well through UV-A II. Oxybenzone can be considered a broad-spectrum absorber. It significantly augments UV-B protection when used in a given formula.","Transient erythema, mild burning sensations; hyperpigmentation. Staining and corneal opacities. Tremors and convulsions after systemic absorption. Occasionally, hypersensitivity."
Hydroquinone,"Hydroquinone is a topical depigmentating agent that produces a reversible depigmentation of the skin by inhibiting enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and suppressing melanocyte metabolic processes.",No systemic adverse reactions have been reported. Occasional hypersensitivity (localized contact dermatitis) may occur in which case the medication should be discontinued.
Inositol Nicotinate,"Inositol Niacinate is a vasodilator and lipid-lowering agent. It improves circulation by releasing histamine, which causes the blood vessels to dilate and breaks up a protein needed for the clotting of blood. It also prevents the formation of lipids in the body, which helps to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels.","The most common side effects are headache, rash, paraesthesia, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, flushing, excessive fluid retention in the body tissues, postural hypotension, fainting"
Infliximab,"Infliximab neutralizes the biological activity of TNFα by binding with high affinity to the soluble and transmembrane forms of TNFα and inhibits binding of TNFα with its receptors. Infliximab does not neutralize TNFα (lymphotoxin-α), a related cytokine that utilizes the same receptors as TNFα. Biological activities attributed to TNFα include: induction of pro inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL) 1 and 6, enhancement of leukocyte migration by increasing endothelial layer permeability and expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells and leukocytes, activation of neutrophil and eosinophil functional activity, induction of acute phase reactants and other liver proteins, as well as tissue degrading enzymes produced by synoviocytes and/or chondrocytes. Cells expressing transmembrane TNFα bound by infliximab can be lysed in vitro or in vivo. Infliximab inhibits the functional activity of TNFα in a wide variety of in vitro bioassays utilizing human fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neutrophils, B and T lymphocytes and epithelial cells. The relationship of these biological response markers to the mechanism(s) by which Infliximab exerts its clinical effects is unknown. Anti-TNFα antibodies reduce disease activity in the cotton-top tamarin colitis model, and decrease synovitis and joint erosions in a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis. Infliximab prevents disease in transgenic mice that develop polyarthritis as a result of constitutive expression of human TNFα, and when administered after disease onset, allows eroded joints to heal.","Most common adverse reactions (>10%)- infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis, and pharyngitis), infusion-related reactions, headache, and abdominal pain."
Indomethacin (Rectal),"Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) having properties of antipyretic and analgesic effects. A great number of pharmacological studies have proved that Indomethacin has strong anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. Unlike the corticosteroids, the effect of Indomethacin is not related to the pituitary gland or the adrenals.","Headache, usually in the morning and mild vertigo may occur during the early weeks of therapy. These symptoms are transient and usually disappear with continued use or by reduction of the dose. Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, epigastric and abdominal pain are often due to large doses of the drug and disappear when the dose is reduced."
Indomethacin (Oral),"Indomethacin is NSAID having property of antipyretic and analgesic effect. A great number of pharmacological studies have proved that Indomethacin has strong anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. Unlike the corticosteriods, the effect of Indomethacin is not related to the pituitary gland or the adrenals. Indomethacin is absorbed promptly following oral administration and peak plasma levels occur within 2 hours. Approximately two thirds of this amount is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. About 90% of a single dose is excreted in 24-48 hours. In a number of controlled clinical trials, Indomethacin has proved to be of great value in the treatment of rheumatic diseases, It relieves pain, reduces joints swelling edema and improves joint mobility.","Headaches, usually in the morning and kild vertigo may occur during the early weeks of therapy. These symptoms are transient and usually disappear with continued use or by reduction of the dose. Rare case of mild psychic disturbances was also reported which subsided after few days of treatment, Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, epigastric and abdominal pain are often due to large doses of the drug and disappear when the dose is reduced. Administration of the capsule immediately after meals with an antacid it necessary, minimize the frequency and the severity of these untoward effects."
Indapamide + Perindopril Arginine,"Perindopril is an ACE inhibitor, which acts by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, reducing the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibiting enzyme kininase, which is involved in the conversion of bradykinin and other substances. Indapamide is a sulfonamide derivative with an indole ring. It inhibits the reabsorption of sodium in the cortical dilution segment, thus increasing urinary output, resulting in an antihypertensive effect.","Asthenia, dizziness, headache, mood swings and/or sleep disturbances, cramps, hypotension, allergic reactions, skin rashes, gastrointestinal disorders, dry cough, dry mouth, risk of dehydration in the elderly and in patients suffering from heart failure; changes in blood test results may occur."
Indapamide + Amlodipine,"Indapamide is a sulphonamide derivative with an indole ring, pharmacologically related to thiazide diuretics, which acts by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium in the cortical dilution segment. It increases the urinary excretion of sodium and chlorides and, to a lesser extent, the excretion of potassium and magnesium, thereby increasing urine output and having an antihypertensive action.Amlodipine is a calcium ion influx inhibitor of the dihydropyridine group (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) and inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle.","The most commonly reported adverse reactions with indapamide and amlodipine given separately are somnolence, dizziness, headache, palpitations, flushing, abdominal pain, nausea, ankle swelling, oedema and fatigue."
Indapamide,"Indapamide is a diuretic antihypertensive. It appears to cause vasodilation, probably by inhibiting the passage of calcium and other ions (sodium, potassium) across membranes. It has an extra-renal antihypertensive action resulting in a decrease in vascular hyperreactivity and a reduction in total peripheral and arteriolar resistance.","Side effects of Indapamide include headache, anorexia, gastric irritation,nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhoea etc."
Indacaterol + Glycopyrronium,"Indacaterol Maleate is a selective β2-adrenergic agonist. Its chemical name is (R)-5-[2-(5,6-Diethylindan-2-ylamino)-1-hydroxyethyl]-8 hydroxy-1H-quinolin-2-one maleate. Indacaterol Maleate has a molecular weight of 508.56 and its empirical formula is C24H28N2O3.C4H4O4. Indacaterol Maleate is a white to very slightly grayish or very slightly yellowish powder. Indacaterol Maleate is freely soluble in N methylpyrrolidone and dimethylformamide, slightly soluble in methanol, ethanol, propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol 400, very slightly soluble in water, isopropyl alcohol and practically insoluble in 0.9% sodium chloride in water, ethyl acetate and n-octanol. Glycopyrronium is a long-acting, specific antimuscarinic agent, in clinical medicine often called an anticholinergic. It has a similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, inhibition of M3-receptors at the smooth muscle results in relaxation. The high potency and slow receptor dissociation found its clinical correlate in significant and long-acting bronchodilation in patients with COPD.","Inhaled medicines may cause inhalation-induced bronchospasm, dehydration, dry mouth, constipation dizziness, insomnia, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders & immune system disorders."
Inactivated Polio Vaccine,Inactivated poliovirus vaccine induces the production of neutralizing antibodies against each type of virus. Administration of the second dose results in rapid increase of antibody levels indicating existance of immunological memory. IPV is able to induce secretory antibody (IgA) produced in the pharynx and gut and reduces pharyngeal excretion of poliovirus.,"Following vaccine administration, a mild erythematous reaction and induration has been observed at the site of injection, in rare cases. In a few instances, the erythema may be accompanied by moderate fever."
Inactivated Hepatitis A vaccine,"The hepatitis A virus belongs to the picornavirus family. It is one of several hepatitis viruses that cause systemic disease with pathology in the liver. The incubation period for hepatitis A averages 28 days (range: 15 to 50 days). The course of hepatitis A infection is extremely variable, ranging from asymptomatic infection to icteric hepatitis and death. The presence of antibodies to HAV confers protection against hepatitis A infection. However, the lowest titer needed to confer protection has not been determined.","Reactions at the site of injection are common but can be recovered within 72 hours without any treatment. Some of the mild and temporary adverse reactions are: pain and redness at the site of injection, fever after vaccination."
Imiquimod,"Imiquimod is a toll-like receptor-7 agonist enhancing both the innate and acquired immune response. It activates the production of numerous compounds, including IFN-α, IL-1, -6, -8, -10, -12, and TNF-α, stimulates natural killer cells and the proliferation of B-cells. It also activates Langerhans cells and promotes their migration to the regional lymph nodes. Imiquimod stimulates TH-1 cells to produce IFN-g, which in turn can activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These cells provide long-term immune memory, which can offer future protection against the previously encountered virus or tumor.","Reported side effects are pustules, genital candidiasis, vaginitis, bacterial infection, fungal infection, upper respiratory tract infection, vulvitis, rhinitis, influenza, lymphadenopathy, anorexia, insomnia, depression, irritability, headache, paraesthesia, dizziness, migraine, somnolence, conjunctival irritation, eyelid oedema, tinnitus, flushing, pharyngitis, nasal congestion, pharyngo laryngeal pain, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomitting, rectal disorder, rectal tenesmus, dry mouth, pruritus, folliculitis, rash erythematous, eczema, rash, increased sweating, urticaria, erythema, face oedema, skin ulcer, myalgia, arthralgia, back pain, pain in extremity, dysuria, genital pain in male, penile disorder, dyspareunia, erectile dysfunction, uterovaginal prolapse, vaginal pain, vaginitis atrophic, vulval disorder, and general disorders and administration site disorders such as pruritus, pain, burning, irritation, erythema, reaction, bleeding, papules, rash, inflammation asthenia, malaise, rigors, lethargy, discomfort, fatigue, discharge, oedema, scar, ulcer, vesicle, warmth, pyrexia etc. Reports have been received of localised hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation following Imiquimod cream use. Clinical studies investigating the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis have detected a 0.4% frequency of alopecia at the treatment site or surrounding area. Reductions in haemoglobin, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophils and platelets have been observed in clinical trials."
Imipramine Hydrochloride,"Imipramine works by inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin. It binds the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and sodium-dependent norepinephrine transporter reducing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin by neurons. Depression has been linked to a lack of stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron by norepinephrine and serotonin. Slowing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, producing knock-on effects in protein kinase signaling which is thought to contribute to changes in neurotransmission and brain physiology which relieves symptoms of depression.","The most frequent of side effects are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability, dizziness, and decreased coordination. Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug. Imipramine usage has been linked to both increases and decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and strokes have been reported. Confusion, disorientation, delusions, insomnia, and anxiety have also been reported as side effects in a small percentage of people taking imipramine. Problems associated with the skin (loss of sensation, numbness and tingling, rashes, spots, itching and puffiness), seizures, and ringing in the ears have also been reported. Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping are all side effects associated with imipramine usage in a small number of people."
Imipenem + Cilastatin,"Imipenem acts as an antimicrobial through the inhibition of cell wall synthesis of various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. This inhibition of cell wall synthesis in gram-negative bateria is attained by binding to pencillin binding proteins (PBPs). In E. coli and selected strains of P. aeruginosa, imipenem has shown to have the highest affinity to PBP-2, PBP-1a, and PBP-1b. This preferential binding to PBP-2 and PBP-1b results in the direct conversion of the individual cell to a spheroblast, which leads to rapid cell lysis and death without filament formation.Cilastatin is a specific and reversible renal dehydropeptidase-I inhibitor. Since the antibiotic, imipenem, is hydrolyzed by dehydropeptidase-I, which resides in the brush border of the renal tubule, cilastatin is administered with imipenem to block the metabolism and thus the inactivation of imipenem so that antibacterial levels of imipenem can be attained in the urine. The drug also prevents the metabolism of leukotriene D4 to leukotriene E4 through the inhibition of leukotriene D4 dipeptidase.","Most common side effects with imipenem are nausea and vomiting. Other side effects reported with this drug are diarrhea, rash, thrombophlebitis, thrombocytosis, neutro-penia, eosinophilia and derangements of liver and renal functions. Use of imipenem is not recommended for patient with history of anaphylactic reaction with penicillin."
Imatinib Mesylate,"Imatinib is a small molecule protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits the activity of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase (TK), as well as several receptor TKs: Kit, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF) coded for by the c-Kit proto-oncogene, the discoidin domain receptors (DDR1 and DDR2), the colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF-1R) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR beta). Imatinib can also inhibit cellular events mediated by activation of these receptor kinases.Absorption and Distribution: Imatinib is well absorbed after oral administration with Cmax achieved within 2 4 hours post-dose. Mean absolute bioavailability is 98%. Mean Imatinib AUC increases proportionally with increasing doses ranging from 25 mg to 1,000 mg. There is no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of Imatinib on repeated dosing, and accumulation is 1.5- to 2.5- fold at a steady state when Imatinib is dosed once daily. At clinically relevant concentrations of Imatinib, binding to plasma proteins in in vitro experiments is approximately 95%, mostly to albumin and 1-acid glycoprotein.Metabolism: CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for metabolism of Imatinib. Other cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, play a minor role in its metabolism. The main circulating active metabolite in humans is the N-demethylated piperazine derivative, formed predominantly by CYP3A4. It shows in vitro potency similar to the parent Imatinib. The plasma AUC for this metabolite is about 15% of the AUC for Imatinib. The plasma protein binding of N-demethylated metabolite CGP74588 is similar to that of the parent compound.Excretion: Imatinib elimination is predominately in the feces, mostly as metabolites. Based on the recovery of compound(s) after an oral 14C-labeled dose of Imatinib, approximately 81% of the dose was eliminated within 7 days, in feces (68% of dose) and urine (13% of dose). Unchanged Imatinib accounted for 25% of the dose (5% urine, 20% feces), the remainder being metabolites. Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, the elimination half-lives of Imatinib and its major active metabolite, the N-demethyl derivative (CGP74588), are approximately 18 and 40 hours, respectively.","The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

Idoxuridine,"Herpes simplex virus utilizes thymidine in the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a metabolite necessary for reproduction. Idoxuridine is identical in chemical structure to thymidine except that the 5-methyl group is replaced by iodine. When idoxuridine is substituted for thymidine in DNA, the cell is unable to utilize the DNA and reproduction ceases.","Common side effects are eye irritation or pain, redness, itching, swelling of the eye, increased sensitivity to light and glare"
Irbesartan,Irbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It blocks the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by binding to AT1 receptors.,"Diarrhoea, fatigue, dyspepsia or heartburn, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, thrombocytopaenia, hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine."
Ipratropium Bromide (Nebuliser Solution),Ipratropium Bromide is a quaternary ammonium compound with anticholinergic properties. It appears to inhibit vagal reflexes by antagonising the action of acetylcholine (the transmitter agent released from the vagus nerve). Anticholinergics prevent the increase in intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) caused by interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptor on bronchial smooth muscle.,"Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, angio-oedema of the tongue, lips and face, urticaria (including giant urticaria), laryngospasm and anaphylactic reactions have been reported, with positive rechallenge in some cases."
Ipratropium Bromide (Inhaler),Ipratropium bromide causes bronchodilation by blocking the action of acetylcholine at parasympathetic site in bronchial smooth muscle. It also inhibits serous and seromucous gland secretions by nasal application.,"Idiosyncratic reactions to lpratropium bromide are rare. Severe adverse effects due to inhibition of muscarinic receptors and ganglion blockade are theoretically possible but unlikely with the metered-dose aerosol. Regular use of ipratropium can lead to a dry mouth through inhibition of salivary flow.Other most common adverse reactions reported are - dryness of the oropharynx (5%); cough, exacerbation of symptoms, & imitation from aerosol (3%); headache (2%); nausea, dizziness, blurred vision/difficulty in accommodation & drying of secretions (1%).Less frequently reported adverse reactions include tachycardia, nervousness, paresthesias, drowsiness, co-ordination difficulty, itching, flushing, alopecia, constipation, tremor & mucosal ulceration.

Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, angio-oedema of tongue, lips & face, urticaria (including giant urticaria), laryngospasm and anaphylactic reaction have been also reported; with positive rechallenge in some cases.Ipratropium bromide dose not produce adverse effects on mucociliary clearance, in contrast to atropine and other muscarinic antagonists. There is no evidence that in the therapeutic does range ipratropium bromide has any adverse effect on bronchial secretion."
Iopamidol,"Iopamidol, an organic Iodine compound and used as a non-ionic water soluble radiographic contrast medium. Iopamidol blocks X-rays as they pass through the body, thereby allowing body structures not containing Iodine to be visualized. The degree of opacity produced by Iopamidol is directly proportional to the total amount of the iodinated contrast agent in the path of the X-rays. The visualization of body structures is dependent upon the distribution and elimination of Iopamidol.","Common side effects are arrhythmias, arterial spasm, flushing, vasodilatation, angina, cardiopulmonary arrest; dizziness, confusion, paraesthesia, visual disturbances, seizure, paralysis, coma, temporary amnesia; inj site pain, pallor, periorbital and facial oedema; coughing, sneezing, rhinitis, asthma, apnoea, laryngeal oedema, chest tightness; watery itchy eyes, lachrymation, conjunctivitis; muscle spasm, involuntary leg movement; tremors, malaise; severe retching and choking, abdominal pain; urogenital pain, haematuria."
Iohexol,"Iohexol provides opacification of blood vessels and permits radiographic visualisation until sufficient haemodilution occurs or sufficient contrast medium has left the site of injection. Being a non-ionic compound, Iohexol yields solutions of lower osmolality than the conventional ionic contrast media. Intravenous or intra-arterial injection of Iohexol causes less pain and sensation of heat than conventional ionic media with similar iodine content. Iohexol solutions cause less cardiac and vascular disturbances on intravascular injection. The transit time of Iohexol through the coronary vascular system is slightly increased compared with conventional ionic contrast media, probably due to the increased viscosity of Iohexol at comparable iodine concentrations. The period of maximal opacification of the renal vessels may begin as early as 30 seconds after IV injection. Urograms become apparent in about 1 to 3 minutes with optimal contrast occurring between 5 to 15 minutes. In nephropathic conditions, particularly when excretory capacity has been altered, the rate of excretion may vary unpredictably, and opacification may be delayed after injection. Severe renal impairment may result in a lack of diagnostic opacification of the collecting system. The initial concentration and volume of the medium, in conjunction with appropriate patient manipulation and the volume of CSF into which the medium is placed, will determine the extent of diagnostic contrast that can be achieved. Following subarachnoid injection, Iohexol will continue to provide good diagnostic contrast by conventional radiography for at least 30 minutes. Slow diffusion of Iohexol takes place throughout the CSF as well as transfer into the circulation. At approximately 1 hour, contrast of diagnostic quality will not usually be available for conventional myelography. However, sufficient contrast for CT myelography will be available for several hours. If CT myelography is to follow, it should be deferred for several hours to allow the degree of contrast to decrease. Following lumbar subarachnoid placement, irrespective of the position in which the patient is later maintained, slow upward diffusion of Iohexol takes place throughout the CSF. CSF contrast enhancement for CT scanning may be expected in the thoracic region in about 1 hour, in the cervical region in about 2 hours and in the basal cisterns in 3 to 4 hours after administration into the lumbar subarachnoid space.","Flushing or a sensation of heat; pain, extravasation, thrombophlebitis at the inj site; nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness; urticaria, pruritus, pallor, sweating, metallic taste, weakness, coughing, rhinitis, sneezing, lachrymation, visual disturbances; hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, transient ECG abnormalities, haemodynamic disturbances; dyspnoea, bronchospasm, angioedema, severe urticaria; convulsions, paraesthesia, paralysis; acute renal failure; thromboembolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia; hyperthyroidism, thyroid storm thyrotoxicosis."
Iodixanol,"Intravascular injection of iodixanol opacifies vessels in the path of flow of the contrast agent, permitting visualization of internal structures. In imaging of the body, iodinated contrast agents diffuse from the vascular into the extravascular space. In a normal brain with an intact blood-brain barrier, contrast does not diffuse into the extravascular space. In patients with a disrupted bloodbrain barrier, contrast agent accumulates in the interstitial space in the region of disruption.","Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 0.5%) in adult patients after Iodixanol injection: Discomfort, warmth, painCardiovascular: angina. Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.Nervous System: agitation, anxiety, insomnia, nervousness, dizziness, headache, migraine, unusual skin sensations, sensory disturbance, fainting, sensation of spinning.

Insulin Lispro,"Insulin Lispro (insulin lispro, rDNA origin) is a human insulin analogue that is a rapid-acting, parenteral blood glucose-lowering agent. Chemically, it is Lys(B28), Pro(B29) human insulin analogue, created when the amino acids at positions 28 and 29 on the insulin B -chain are reversed. Insulin Lispro is synthesized in a special non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that has been genetically altered by the addition of the gene for insulin lispro. The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin lispro is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver.","Clinical studies comparing Insulin Lispro with Regular human insulin did not demonstrate a difference in frequency of adverse events between the two treatments. Adverse events commonly associated with human insulin therapy include the following: Body as a Whole: allergic reactions. Skin and Appendages: injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash. Other: hypoglycemia."
Insulin Human [rDNA] + Isophane Insulin Human,"Insulin Human (rDNA) is human insulin made by recombinant DNA technology. It has the same structure and function as natural insulin.

Few cases of the allergic reaction such as red and swollen or itching are reported. It usually disappears in a few days. In some instances, the allergy may be caused by other reasons rather than insulin, such as disinfectant and poor injection technique."
Insulin Human [Long-Acting],"The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver. Insulatard is a long-acting insulin. Onset of action is within 1½ hours, reaches a maximum effect within 4-12 hours and the entire time of duration is approximately 24 hours.Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes. Consequently, the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics. This process is influenced by several factors (e.g. insulin dosage, injection route and site, thickness of subcutaneous fat, type of diabetes). The pharmacokinetics of insulins is therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation","Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect during insulin treatment and symptoms of hypoglycemia may occur suddenly.

Insulin also inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. Insulin Degludec forms multihexamers when injected into the subcutaneous tissue resulting in a subcutaneous insulin degludec depot. The protracted time action profile of Insulin Degludec is predominantly due to delayed absorption of insulin degludec from the subcutaneous tissue to the systemic circulation and to a lesser extent due to binding of insulin degludec to circulating albumin.","Nasopharyngitis, Severe hypoglycemic episode, Upper respiratory tract infection, Headache, Diarrhea, Sinusitis, Gastroenteritis, Injection site reactions, Peripheral edema"
Insulin Aspart + Insulin Aspart Protamine,"Insulin Aspart & Insulin Aspart Protamine is a human insulin analog suspension containing 30% Insulin Aspart & 70% Insulin Aspart Protamine used to lower blood glucose. Insulin Aspart is homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the Amino Acid Proline by Aspartic Acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). The primary activity of insulin, including Insulin Aspart is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin, and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.","Most common side effects are hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity and allergic reactions, hypokalemia, injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus and rash."
Insulin Aspart,The primary activity of Insulin Aspart is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin Aspart bind to the insulin receptors on muscle and fat cells and lower blood glucose by facilitating the cellular uptake of glucose and simultaneously inhibiting the output of glucose from the liver.,"Side effects of Insulin Aspart are hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus and rash."
Isotretinoin (Topical),"Isotretinoin produces its effects through altering progress through the cell cycle, cell differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. These actions reduce sebum production, preventing the blockage of pores, and growth of acne causing bacteria. Isotretinoin and 4-oxo-isotretinoin both significantly reduce the production of sebum. Isotretinoin has little to no affinity for retinol binding proteins (RBPs) and retinoic acid nuclear receptors (RARs). Tretinoin and 4-oxo-tretinion bind to the RAR-γ receptor, which is suspected to be part of the action of acne treatment by isotretinoin. Isotretinoin induces apoptosis in sebocytes, leading to a decrease in sebum production. Isotretinoin also reduces the formation of comedones by reducing hyperkeratinization through an unknown mechanism. Isotretinoin does not directly kill bacteria but it does reduce the size of sebum ducts and makes the microenvironment less hospitable to acne causing bacteria. It may also increase immune mechanisms and alter chemotaxis of monocytes to reduce inflammation.","In normal use, Isotretinoin may cause stinging, burning or irritation; erythema and peeling at the site of application may occur. If undue irritation occurs, treatment should be interrupted temporarily and resumed once the reaction subsides. If irritation persists, treatment should be discontinued. Reactions will normally resolve on discontinuation of therapy."

The side effects are generally reversible after altering the dose or discontinuation of treatment, however some may persist after treatment has stopped. The following symptoms are the most commonly reported undesirable effects with Isotretinoin: dryness of the skin, dryness of the mucosae e.g. of the lips (cheilitis), the nasal mucosa (epistaxis) and the eyes (conjunctivitis).The incidence of the adverse events was calculated from pooled clinical trial data involving 824 patients and from post-marketing data.

Isosorbide Mononitrate,"Isosorbide mononitrate is the major active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and most of the clinical activity of the dinitrate is attributable to the mononitrate. The principal pharmacological action of isosorbide mononitrate is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and  pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction and coronary dilatation remains undefined.","Headache, feelings of dizziness, hypotension may occur sometimes."
Isopropyl Alcohol + Hydrogen Peroxide + Glycerol,"Isopropyl Alcohol is an isomer of propyl alcohol with antibacterial properties. Although the exact mechanism of isopropanol's disinfecting action is not known, it might kill cells by denaturing cell proteins and DNA, interfering with cellular metabolism, and dissolving cell lipo-protein membranes. Isopropanol is used in soaps and lotions as an antiseptic. 70 % isopropyl alcohol solution kills microorganisms by dissolving plasma membrane of the cell wall.Glycerol: used as humectant, but other emollients may be used for skin care, provided that they are cheap, widely available and miscible in water and alcohol and do not add to toxicity, or promote allergy.Hydrogen peroxide: used to inactivate contaminating bacterial spores in the solution and is not an active substance for hand antisepsis.","Inhaling large amounts of isopropyl alcohol can cause nausea, vomiting, irritation of the nose and mucous membranes, throat irritations, and even difficulty with breathing as coughing can occur making it difficult for you to catch your breath.

Isoflurane,"Isoflurane may be used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Adequate data have not been developed to establish its application in obstetrical anesthesia.Induction of and recovery from Isoflurane anesthesia are rapid. Isoflurane has a mild pungency, which limits the rate of induction, although excessive salivation or tracheobronchial secretions do not appear to be stimulated. Pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are readily obtunded. The level of anesthesia may be changed rapidly with Isoflurane. Isoflurane is a profound respiratory depressant. Respiration must be monitored closely and supported when necessary. As anesthetic dose is increased, tidal volume decreases and respiratory rate is unchanged. This depression is partially reversed by surgical stimulation, even at deeper levels of anesthesia. Isoflurane evokes a sigh response reminiscent of that seen with diethyl ether and enflurane, although the frequency is less than with enflurane.Blood pressure decreases with induction of anesthesia but returns toward normal with surgical stimulation. Progressive increases in depth of anesthesia produce corresponding decreases in blood pressure. Nitrous oxide diminishes the inspiratory concentration of Isoflurane required to reach a desired level of anesthesia and may reduce the arterial hypotension seen with Isoflurane alone. Heart rhythm is remarkably stable. With controlled ventilation and normal PaCO2, cardiac output is maintained despite increasing depth of anesthesia, primarily through an increase in heart rate, which compensates for a reduction in stroke volume. The hypercapnia, which attends spontaneous ventilation during Isoflurane anesthesia further increases heart rate and raises cardiac output above awake levels. Isoflurane does not sensitize the myocardium to exogenously administered epinephrine in the dog. Limited data indicate that subcutaneous injection of 0.25 mg of epinephrine (50 mL of 1:200,000 solution) does not produce an increase in ventricular arrhythmias in patients anesthetized with Isoflurane.Muscle relaxation is often adequate for intra-abdominal operations at normal levels of anesthesia. Complete muscle paralysis can be attained with small doses of muscle relaxants. All commonly used muscle relaxants are markedly potentiated with Isoflurane, the effect being most profound with the nondepolarizing type. Neostigmine reverses the effect of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants in the presence of Isoflurane. All commonly used muscle relaxants are compatible with Isoflurane.Isoflurane can produce coronary vasodilation at the arteriolar level in selected animal models; the drug is probably also a coronary dilator in humans. Isoflurane, like some other coronary arteriolar dilators, has been shown to divert blood from collateral dependent myocardium to normally perfused areas in an animal model (“coronary steal”). Clinical studies to date evaluating myocardial ischemia, infarction and death as outcome parameters have not established that the coronary arteriolar dilation property of Isoflurane is associated with coronary steal or myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease","Nausea, Vomiting, Shivering, Dose-dependent hypotension, Arrhythmias, Malignant hyperthermia (rare), Elevations in white blood count, May decrease creatinine and increase BUN, Ileus, severe (fatal), Hepatic dysfunction (postoperative period),Respiratory depression may occur"
Iron Sucrose Injection [Elemental Iron],"The therapeutic class of Iron Sucrose is haematinic. Iron Sucrose Injection USP is a brown, sterile, aqueous, complex of Polynuclear Iron (III) Hydroxide in Sucrose for Intravenous use. The drug product contains approximately 30% Sucrose w/v (300 mg/ml) and has a pH of 10.5-11.1. Following intravenous administration, Iron Sucrose Injection is dissociated into Iron and Sucrose by the reticuloendothelial system, and Iron is transferred from the blood to a pool of Iron in the liver and bone marrow. Ferritin, an Iron storage protein, binds and sequesters Iron in a nontoxic form, from which Iron is easily available. Iron binds to plasma transferrin, which carries Iron within the plasma and the extracellular fluid to supply the tissues. The transferrin receptor, located in the cell, and the transferrin-receptor complex is returned to the cell membrane. Transferrin without Iron (apotransferrin) is then released to the plasma. The intracellular Iron becomes (mostly) haemoglobin in circulating red blood cells (RBCs). Transferrin synthesis is increased and ferritin production reduced in Iron deficiency. The converse is true when Iron is plentiful. Its elimination halflife is 6 h, total clearance is 1.2 L/h, non-steady state apparent volume of distribution is 10.0 L and steady state apparent volume of distribution is 7.9 L. In Iron Sucrose, its Iron component appears to distribute mainly in blood and to some extent in extravascular fluid. A significant amount of the administered Iron distributes in the liver, spleen and bone marrow and that the bone marrow is an Iron trapping compartment and not a reversible volume distribution. The sucrose component is eliminated mainly through urinary excretion.","Adverse reactions, whether or not related to Iron Sucrose injection are as follows: hypotension, cramps/leg cramps, nausea, headache, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some of these symptoms may be seen in patients with chronic renal failure or on hemodialysis not receiving intravenous iron. 
Body as a Whole: headache, fever, pain, asthenia, unwell, malaise, accidental injury. Cardiovascular Disorders
General: hypotension, chest pain, hypertension, hypervolemia.

Anaphylactoid reactions including patients who experienced serious or life-threatening reactions (anaphylactic shock, loss of consciousness or collapse, bronchospasm with dyspnea, or convulsion) associated with Iron Sucrose administration can occur. So, patients should be given a small test dose initially."

Irbesartan + Hydrochlorothiazide,"Irbesartan: Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the RAS and also stimulates aldosterone synthesis and secretion by adrenal cortex, cardiac contraction, renal resorption of sodium, activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and smooth muscle cell growth. Irbesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively binding to the AT1 angiotensin II receptor. There is also an AT2 receptor in many tissues, but it is not involved in cardiovascular homeostasis.Irbesartan is a specific competitive antagonist of AT1 receptors with a much greater affinity (more than 8500-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor, and no agonist activity.Blockade of the AT1 receptor removes the negative feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II do not overcome the effects of irbesartan on blood pressure.Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE or renin or affect other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be involved in the cardiovascular regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis. Because irbesartan does not inhibit ACE, it does not affect the response to bradykinin; whether this has clinical relevance is not known.Hydrochlorothiazide: Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.","Irbesartan: Hyperkalemia (19%), Chest pain (2%), Tachycardia (1%), Abnormal urination (2%), Musculoskeletal pain (6%), Flu-like syndrome (3%), Edema (3%), Tachycardia (1%), Chest pain (2%), Creatinine increased (1%), Increased BUN (2%), Dizziness (10%), URI (9%), Orthostatic hypotension (5%), Fatigue (4%), Diarrhea (3%), Dyspepsia (2%)Hydrochlorothiazide: Anorexia, Epigastric distress, Hypotension, Orthostatic hypotension, Photosensitivity, Anaphylaxis, Anemia, Confusion, Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Dizziness, Hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia, Hyperuricemia, Headache"

Ketotifen Fumarate (Oral),"Ketotifen has anti-allergic properties and has been used similarly, to sodium chromoglycate in the prophylactic treatment of asthma. It also has the properties of an antihistamine. Ketotifen possesses marked anti-anaphylactic properties and is effective in preventing an asthmatic attacks. Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks. Progressive reduction of corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators was also possible. The prophylactic activity of Ketotifen may take several weeks to become fully established.

Ketorolac Tromethamine (Ophthalmic),"Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) chemically related to indomethacin and tolmetin. Ketorolac tromethamine is a racemic mixture of [-]S- and [+]R-enantiomeric forms, with the S-form having analgesic activity. Its antiinflammatory effects are believed to be due to inhibition of both cylooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which leads to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis leading to decreased formation of precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes from arachidonic acid. The resultant reduction in prostaglandin synthesis and activity may be at least partially responsible for many of the adverse, as well as the therapeutic, effects of these medications. Analgesia is probably produced via a peripheral action in which blockade of pain impulse generation results from decreased prostaglandin activity. However, inhibition of the synthesis or actions of other substances that sensitize pain receptors to mechanical or chemical stimulation may also contribute to the analgesic effect. In terms of the ophthalmic applications of ketorolac - ocular administration of ketorolac reduces prostaglandin E2 levels in aqueous humor, secondary to inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis.","Transient stinging and burning on instillation, allergic reactions, corneal edema, iritis, ocular inflammation, ocular irritation, superficial keratitis and superficial ocular infections.

Ketorolac Tromethamine,Ketorolac Tromethamine is a potent analgesic of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It acts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme system and hence inhibits the prostaglandin synthesis. It demonstrates a minimal anti-inflammatory effect at its analgesic dose.,"Commonly occurring side effects are nausea, vomiting, gastro-intestinal bleeding, melana, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, anxiety, drowsiness, headache, excessive thirst, fatigue, bradycardia, hypertension, palpitation, chest pain, infertility in female and pulmonary edema."
Ketoprofen (Topical),"Ketoprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic actions. In addition to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, it stabilizes lysosomal membranes in vitro and in vivo, inhibits leukotriene synthesis in vitro at high concentrations, and also exhibits antibradykinin activity in vivo. Ketoprofen produces analgesia by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins peripherally and centrally. It has also been suggested that Ketoprofen causes the suppression of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS (probably in the hypothalamus) leading to its antipyretic effect.","Immune System disorders- Not known: Anaphylactic shock, angioedema, hypersensitivity reactions.Gastrointestinal disorders- Although plasma levels after administration of Ketoprofen gel are much lower than those reached after oral administration, systemic gastrointestinal side effects (such as nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and flatulence) are possible under rare circumstances depending on the amount of gel applied and the application of the gel to a large area of skin. Uncommon: Nausea. Not known: Abdominal pain, vomiting, flatulence.Skin and Subcutaneous tissue disorders- Uncommon: Erythema, pruritus, eczema.

Ketoconazole (Tablet),"Ketoconazole interferes with biosynthesis of triglycerides and phopholipids by blocking fungal CYP450, thus altering cell membrane permeability in susceptible fungi. It also inhibits other fungal enzymes resulting in the accumulation of toxic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide.","Ketoconazole is very well tolerated. Nausea and itching may occasionally occur. In some patients, an idosyncratic liver reaction may occur (incidence 1:10000)."
Ketoconazole (Shampoo),"Ketoconazole 2% shampoo is a broad spectrum imidazole-dioxolane, synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floc-cosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare).","Topical treatment with ketoconazole shampoo 2% is generally well tolerated. As with other shampoos, a local burning sensation, itching or contact dermatitis (due to irritation or allergy) may occur on exposed areas. Oily and dry hair have been reported rarely with the use of ketoconazole shampoo 2%."
Ketoconazole (Cream),"Ketoconazole interacts with 14-α-sterol demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. This results in inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and increased fungal cellular permeability due to reduced amounts of ergosterol present in the fungal cell membrane. This metabolic inhibition also results in accumulation of 14α-methyl-3,6-diol, a toxic metabolite. The increase in membrane fluidity is also thought to produce impairment of membrane-bound enzyme systems as components become less closely packed.","Commonly observed adverse reactions to Ketoconazole cream in clinical trials were skin application site burning sensation, erythema and pruritus. Uncommon adverse reactions are application site bleeding, discomfort, dryness, inflammation, irritation, paraesthesia and reaction; bullous eruption, dermatitis contact, rash, skin exfoliation and sticky skin."
Ketamine,Ketamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that blocks glutamate. It has a direct action on the cortex and limbic system. It produces a cataleptic-like state wherein the patient is withdrawn from the surrounding environment.,"Emergence reactions (e.g. vivid dreams, hallucinations, confusion, irrational behaviour); increased muscle tone sometimes resembling seizures; temporary HTN and tachycardia, hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, apnoea, laryngospasm, resp depression, diplopia, nystagmus, nausea, vomiting, lacrimation, hypersalivation, raised intraocular and CSF pressure, transient rash and pain at inj site, cystitis."
Ivermectin (Topical),"Ivermectin, a member of the avermectin class, causes death of parasites, primarily through binding selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride channels, which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligandgated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The selective activity of compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that some mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the avermectins have a low affinity for mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels, and Ivermectin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier in humans.","Common side effects are-

Conjunctivitis
Ocular hyperemia
Eye irritation
Dandruff
Dry skin
Skin burning sensation etc."
Ivermectin (Tablet),"Ivermectin selectively binds and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels, which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells leading to an increase in the permeability of cell membranes to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell and, ultimately, death of the parasite.","Strongyloidiasis: In four clinical studies involving a total of 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg of Ivermectin, the following adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Ivermectin.

The following adverse reactions have been reported since the drug was registered overseas: hypotension (mainly orthostatic hypotension), worsening of bronchial asthma, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome."
Ivabradine,"Ivabradine is a pure heart rate lowering agent. It acts by selective and specific inhibition of the cardiac pacemaker I f current that controls the spontaneous diastolic depolarization in the sinus node and regulates heart rate. By decreasing heart rate, Ivabradine decreases the cardiac workload and therefore oxygen consumption. Concomitantly, Ivabradine prolongs diastole allowing increased perfusion of coronary arteries and increased oxygen supply to the heart. The cardiac effects are specific to the sinus node with no effect on intra-atrial, atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction times, nor on myocardial contractility or ventricular repolarization.","Visual symptoms, blurred vision, bradycardia, 1st degree AV block, ventricular extrasystoles, headaches, and dizziness."
Itraconazole,"Itraconazole is an orally active triazole antifungal agent, having broad-spectrum activity and a favourable pharmacokinetic profile.

Lanthanum Carbonate,"Lanthanum Carbonate is a phosphate binder that reduces absorption of phosphate by forming insoluble Lanthanum phosphate complexes that pass through the Gl tract unabsorbed. Both serum phosphate and calcium phosphate product are reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate absorption.In vitro studies have shown that Lanthanum binds phosphate in the physiologically relevant pH range of 3 to 7. In simulated gastric fluid, Lanthanum binds approximately 97% of the available phosphate at pH 3-5 and 67% at pH 7, when Lanthanum is present in a two-fold molar excess to phosphate. Bile acids have not been shown to affect the phosphate binding affinity of Lanthanum. In order to bind dietary phosphate, Lanthanum Carbonate must be administered with or immediately after meals.","The most common adverse reactions for Lanthanum Carbonate were gastrointestinal events, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and they generally abated over time with continued dosing. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Lanthanum Carbonate constipation, dyspepsia, allergic skin reactions, and tooth injury while chewing the tablet."
Lansoprazole + Amoxicillin + Clarithromycin,Lansoprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor which inhibits the stomach's production of gastric acids. Amoxicillin is a penicillin antibiotic. It acts by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.lt inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the cell walls of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic.It prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis. It binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome and thus inhibits the translation of peptides,"Adverse reactions which were reported as possibly or probably related to treatment (>3%) in clinical trials when all three components of this therapy were given concomitantly are listed below and divided by body systems. Digestive system: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dark stools, dry mouth, glossitis, oral moniliasis, stomatitis, tongue discoloration. Musculoskeletal System: myalgia. Nervous System: confusion, headache, dizziness; Skin: skin reactions. Urogenital System: vaginitis,vaginal moniliasis."
Lansoprazole,"Lansoprazole is a substituted benzimidazole, and is also known as PPI due to its property to block the final step of acid secretion by inhibiting H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system in gastric parietal cell. Both basal and stimulated acid are inhibited.","Severe or irreversible adverse effects: The possible induction of carcinoid tumors by profound acid suppression, and a rise in serum gastrin may occur. There is a rise in serum gastrin levels in the first 3 months of treatment, which are then maintained though at a lower level than those found in pernicious anaemia. Long term treatment with a proton pump inhibitor in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection may accelerate the development of atrophic gastritis.Symptomatic adverse effect: Dose dependent diarrhoea occurs with an incidence of about 4% at 30 mg per day, rising to 8% at 60 mg per day. Headache occurs in 2-3% of treated patients"
Lamotrigine,"The exact mechanism of action of lamotrigine is not fully elucidated, as it may exert cellular activities that contribute to its efficacy in a range of conditions. Although chemically unrelated, lamotrigine actions resemble those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes, thereby modulating the release of presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitters.Lamotrigine likely acts by inhibiting sodium currents by selective binding to the inactive sodium channel, suppressing the release of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate. The mechanism of action of lamotrigine in reducing anticonvulsant activity is likely the same in managing bipolar disorder. Studies on lamotrigine have identified its binding to sodium channels in a fashion similar to local anesthetics, which could explain the demonstrated clinical benefit of lamotrigine in some neuropathic pain states.Lamotrigine displays binding properties to several different receptors. In laboratory binding assays, it demonstrates weak inhibitory effect on the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. Lamotrigine also weakly binds to Adenosine A1/A2 receptors, α1/α2/β adrenergic receptors, dopamine D1/D2 receptors, GABA A/B receptors, histamine H1 receptors, κ-opioid receptor (KOR), mACh receptors and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors with an IC50>100 µM. Weak inhibitory effects were observed at sigma opioid receptors. An in vivo study revealed evidence that lamotrigine inhibits Cav2.3 (R-type) calcium currents, which may also contribute to its anticonvulsant effects.","Common side effects of Lamotrigine include-dizziness, tremor, headache, rash, blurred vision, fever, lack of coordination, abdominal pain, infections, sleepiness, back pain, vomiting, diarrhea, tiredness, insomnia, dry mouth, stuffy nose, sore throat."
Lamivudine + Zidovudine + Nevirapine,"Lamivudine, Zidovudine & Nevirapine synergistically reduce the viral resistance and inhibit reverse transcriptase via DNA chain termination.Lamivudine: Intracellularly, Lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active 5’-triphosphate metabolite, Lamivudine triphosphate (L-TP). The principal mode of action of L-TP is inhibition of reverse transcription (RT) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleoside analogue. Following oral administration, Lamivudine is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. Binding to plasma protein is low.Zidovudine: Intracellularly, Zidovudine is phosphorylated to its active 5’-triphosphate metabolite, Zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP). The principal mode of action of ZDV-TP is inhibition of RT via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleoside analogue. Following oral administration, Zidovudine is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. Binding to plasma protein is low. Zidovudine is eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism.Nevirapine: Nevirapine binds directly to reverse transcriptase (RT) and blocks the RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities by causing a disruption of the enzyme's catalytic site. The activity of nevirapine does not compete with template or nucleoside triphosphates.","Lamivudine: Pancreatitis, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, cough, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, headache, insomnia, anaemia, neutropenia, drug induced skin rash, hair loss.Zidovudine: Headache (which may be severe, has been reported in up to 63% of patients receiving Zidovudine and asthenia has been reported in 9-69%), malaise and fatigue, fever or chills, nausea (61% cases), diaphoresis, dyspnoea, rash and taste perversion have been reported. Skin rashes and myalgia has been reported in patients receiving Zidovudine. Myopathy and myositis with pathologic changes similar to that produced by HIV infection, have been associated with prolonged use of Zidovudine. The major adverse effect is bone marrow toxicity resulting in severe anaemia and/or neutropenia. Patients with low serum folate or vitamin B12 concentrations may be at increased risk for developing bone marrow toxicity during Zidovudine therapy. There also are limited data suggesting that bone marrow of patients with fulminant acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) may be more sensitive to Zidovudine induced toxicity than that of patients with less advanced disease (eg, AIDS related complex). Anaemia and granulocytopenia usually resolve when Zidovudine is discontinued or when dosage is decreased. Lactic acidosis (in the absence of hypoxaemia) and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including some fatalities, have been reported in patients receiving Zidovudine.Nevirapine: More frequent incidences are skin rash, diarrhoea, gastrointestinal problems, headache, nausea and stomach pain. Incidence of less frequents are aphthous stomatitis, fever, hepatitis and Stevens Johnson syndrome."

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, have been reported."
Lactulose,"Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide. Lactulose is metabolized in the colon by the saccharolytic bacteria, producing low molecular weight organic acids (mainly lactic acid), which lowers the pH of the colon contents, promote the retention of water by an osmotic effect; thus increasing peristaltic activity. Lactulose is minimally absorbed; therefore, the pharmacokinetics of the absorbed material are not relevant to the principal therapeutic action.","Occasionally flatulence, cramp and abdominal discomfort can occur at the beginning of treatment; this is rapidly eliminated by reducing the dose. Overdose can result in diarrhoea. In abuse, loss of electrolytes (primarily potassium)."
Lactitol Monohydrate,"Lactitol Monohydrate is a disaccharide derivatives consisting of galactose and sorbitol, which is only minimally absorbed and is not hydrolysed by the disaccharidases of the GIT and thus reaches the colon unchanged. In the colon it is broken down to short chain low molecular weight organic acids by the intestinal flora, resulting in an increase in osmotic pressure in the colon, thereby causing an increase in the stool water content and stool volume, which explains the laxative effect. Lactitol Monohydrate produces its effect in the lumen of the colon, where it is virtually 100% bioavailable. It is absorbed only in minimal amounts. Up to 2% can be found unchanged in the urine.","At the start of the treatment with lactitol may produce abdominal discomforts such as flatulence, pain, cramps or sensation of fullness. Such effects tend to diminish or disappear after a few days of regular intake of Lactitol. Occasionally, nausea or anal pruritus has been reported in some cases."
Lactic acid + Sodium PCA,"Lactic acid: It is commonly used for lubricating and moisturising skin, thus relieving dryness and itch.Sodium PCA: It is a keratolytic agent. It encourages exfoliation of the skin and opening up of the plugged follicles, which helps re-establish the normal skin- cell replacement cycle. For milder acne, salicylic acid helps unclog pores to resolve and prevent lesions.","Most emollients can be used safely and effectively with no side effects. However, burning, stinging, redness, or irritation may occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly."
Lactase,Lactase is an enzyme that helps to prevent symptoms of lactose intolerance by breaking down milk sugar (lactose) to produce glucose and galactose via hydrolysis and making dairy foods easier to digest.,"There are no major side effects reported. The very few side effects may include rash, difficulty in breathing, tightness in chest etc."
Lacosamide,"It is proposed that lacosamide's inhibition of sodium channels is responsible for analgesia. Lacosamide may be selective for inhibiting depolarized neurons rather than neurons with normal resting potentials. Pain and nociceptor hyperexcitability are associated with neural membrane depolarization. Lacosamide binds to collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a phosphoprotein which is expressed primarily in the nervous system and is involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth. The role CRMP-2 of binding in seizure control is hasn't been elucidated.","Adjunctive therapy: Most common adverse reactions in adults (≥10% and greater than placebo) are diplopia, headache, dizziness, nauseaMonotherapy: Most common adverse reactions are similar to those seen in adjunctive therapy studiesPediatric patients: Adverse reactions are similar to those seen in adult patients"
Lacidipine,"Lacidipine inhibits the influx of calcium into smooth muscle cells by the competitive inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium 'L' channels. This action results in the inhibition of the effects triggered by the influx of calcium into the cells, such as the activation of the contractile proteins in smooth muscle.","Lacidipine is generally well tolerated. Some individuals may experience minor side effects like flushing, palpitation, edema, headache, dizziness, rarely gastro-intestinal disturbances, gum hyperplasia, mood disturbances, asthenia, polyuria, muscle cramps, skin rash etc."
Labetalol Hydrochloride (Tablet),"Labetalol non-selectively antagonizes beta-adrenergic receptors, and selectively antagonizes alpha-1-adrenergic receptors. Following oral administration, labetalol has 3 times the beta-blocking ability than alpha-blocking ability. This increases to 6.9 times following intravenous administration. Antagonism of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors leads to vasodilation and decreased vascular resistance. This leads to a decrease in blood pressure that is most pronounced while standing. Antagonism of beta-1-adrenergic receptors leads to a slight decrease in heart rate. Antagonism of beta-2-adrenergic receptors leads to some of the side effects of labetalol such as bronchospasms, however this may be slightly attenuated by alpha-1-adrenergic antagonism. Labetalol leads to sustained vasodilation over the long term without a significant decrease in cardiac output or stroke volume, and a minimal decrease in heart rate.","Most side effects are mild and transient and occur early in the course of treatment. The incidences of adverse reactions include Fatigue, Asthenia, Headache, Nausea, Vomiting, Dyspepsia, Abdominal pain, Diarrhea, Taste distortion, Dizziness, Paresthesia, Nasal stuffiness, Increased sweating, Edema, Postural hypotension, Bradycardia, Dyspnea, Rash, Vision abnormality and Vertigo."
Labetalol Hydrochloride (Injection),"Labetalol is a competitive antagonist at b1 and b2 adrenoreceptors and has some intrinsic activity at b2 adrenoreceptors. Labetalol has, in addition to its b-blocking action, a competitive antagonist action at postsynaptic a-adrenoreceptors. In isolated tissues Labetalol is four to eight times more potent at b than a-adrenoreceptors.","Adverse effects reported are postural hypotension (avoid upright position during and for 3 hours after intravenous administration), tiredness, weakness, headache, rashes, scalp tingling, difficulty in micturition, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting; liver damage."
L-Ornithine L-Aspartate + Pancreatin,"Pancreatin is a preparation of Pancreatin having protease, lipase and amylase enzyme activity. Pancreatin hydrolyses fats to glycerol and fatty acids, changes protein into proteoses and derived substances and converts starch into dextrins and sugars. Pancreatin is employed in the conditions where the secretion of pancreatic juice is defcient.Hepatic encephalopathy continues to be a major clinical problem and the current decade has not witnessed major therapeutic breakthroughs in this area. L-ornithine-L-aspartate (LOLA) is not frequently used as there are still some reservations about its benefits. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of LOLA in the management of hepatic encephalopathy.","The following is a list of possible side-effects that may occur in medicines that contain L-Ornithine-L-Aspartate / Pancreatin. This is not a comprehensive list. These side-effects are possible, but do not always occur. Some of the side-effects may be rare but serious. Consult your doctor if you observe any of the following side-effects, especially if they do not go away.

Nausea
Vomiting
Abdominal
Stomach pain
Bloating
Diarrhea"
L-Ornithine L-Aspartate,"L-Ornithine L-Aspartate is a stable combination of two important endogenous Amino Acids, L-Ornithine and L-Aspartate. After administration, it quickly breaks down into L-Ornithine and L-Aspartate. L-Ornithine being a substrate of urea cycle, converts toxic ammonia into non-toxic urea which is eliminated via kidneys, helping the diseased liver to carry out its normal function smoothly (detoxification). The process lowers the elevated level of ammonia in blood (hyperammonemia) which is a common problem in most of the liver diseases. L-Aspartate is an essential component of citric acid cycle which liberates energy (ATP), and thus helps in regeneration of damaged liver cells.",Very rarely side effects like nausea and vomiting occur. These side effects are usually transient and do not necessitate the withdrawal of the drug.
Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride,"This preparation contains Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride. Levocetirizine is the active (Levo) isomer of cetirizine. It is a new highly effective and well-tolerated nonsedating antihistamine with potent antiallergic properties. It has a two-fold higher affinity for H1 receptors than cetirizine. Levocetirizine has a rapid and long-acting action, allowing once-a-day administration.","Generally, levocetirizine is well tolerated. However, a few side effects like headache, dry mouth, fatigue and skin rash have been reported rarely."
Levocarnitine,"Levocarnitine is a naturally occurring substance required in mammalian energy metabolism. It has been shown to facilitate long-chain fatty acid entry into cellular mitochondria, thereby delivering substrate for oxidation and subsequent energy production. Fatty acids are utilized as an energy substrate in all tissues except the brain. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, fatty acids are the main substrate for energy production.","Generally, Levocarnitine is well tolerated. However, few side effects including transient nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhoea may occur."
Levobupivacaine Hydrochloride,Levobupivacaine is a long acting local anaesthetic of the amide type. It is the S-enantiomer of bupivacaine. It blocks nerve conduction in sensory and motor nerves mainly by interacting with voltage sensitive sodium channels on the cell membrane. It also interferes with impulse transmission and conduction in other tissues. Levobupivacaine is given as the hydrochloride for infiltration anaesthesia and regional nerve blocks including epidural block. It is contraindicated in obstetric paracervical block and IV regional anaesthesia (Bier's block). The 0.75% solution is also contraindicated for epidural blocks in obstetrics.,"CNS effects such as restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, confusion, respiratory depression and convulsions.

Levamisole,Levamisole is the active laevo-isomer of tetramisole. It works by paralysing susceptible intestinal worms which are then excreted from the intestines. Levamisole also enhances cellular immune responses in humans.,"Side-effects are infrequent. They are usually mild and transient and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, giddiness(dizziness) and headache. An encephalopathylike syndrome has been reported to have occurred in a few patients two or three weeks after treatment."
Leuprorelin Acetate,"Leuprorelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. Following an initial stimulation of gonadotrophins, continuous admin of Leuprorelin leads to down regulation of GnRH receptors and subsequently reduces pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. Reduced gonadotrophin levels lead to inhibition of sex hormone (testosterone and oestrogen) production. Within 2-4 wk after treatment initiation, testosterone levels in male may be reduced to below castrate threshold.","Treatment of precocious puberty: General pain, headache, acne, rash, seborrhoea, emotional lability, vaginitis, vaginal bleeding vaginal dischargeTreatment of prostate cancer: Transient worsening of signs and symptoms (usually increase in bone pain), ECG changes, high blood pressure, peripheral oedema, anorexia, constipation, nausea, vomiting, anaemia, myalgia, dizziness, general pain, headache, insomnia or sleep disorder, sinus congestion, urinary frequency/urgency, haematuria, UTI, asthaenia, physiological effects of decreased testosterone (e.g. gynaecomastia, breast tenderness, decreased testicular size, hot flashes, impotence).Treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids treatment: General pain, headache, asthaenia, nausea, vomiting, oedema, weight changes, acne, hirsutism, dizziness, insomnia, sleep disturbance, paraesthesias, skin reactions, effects of hypoestrogenism such as hot flashes, joint disorder, myalgia, decreased libido, depression, emotional lability, nervousness, breast tenderness, vaginitis."
Letrozole,"Mechanism of Action: Letrozole is a potent and highly specific nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of estrogen biosynthesis in all tissues. Letrozole exerts its antitumor effect by depriving estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells of their growth stimulus. In postmenopausal women, estrogens are derived mainly from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which coverts adrenal androgens primarily androstenedione and testosterone-to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of estrogen biosynthesis in the peripheral tissues and the malignant tissues can be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.In healthy postmenopausal women, single doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 2.5mg letrozole suppress serum oestrone and oestradiol by 75-78% and 78% from baseline respectively. Maximum suppression is achieved in 48-78 hours. In post-menopausal patients, with advanced breast cancer, daily doses of 0.1 to 5mg suppress plasma concentration of oestradiol, oestrone, and oestrone sulphate by 78-95% from baseline in all patients treated. Letrozole had no effect on plasma androgen concentrations (androstenedione and testosterone) among healthy postmenopausal women after single doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 2.5mg indicating that the blockade of estrogen biosynthesis does not lead to accumulation of androgenic precursors. Impairment of adrenal steroidogenesis has not been observed.Pharmacokinetics: Letrozole is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (absolute bioavailability 99.9%). Food slightly decreases the rate of absorption, but the extent of absorption remains unchanged. The minor effect of the absorption rate is not considered to be of clinical relevance and therefore letrozole may be taken after, with or before food. Plasma protein binding of letrozole is approximately 60%, mainly to albumin (55%). The concentration of letrozole in erythrocytes is about 80% of that in plasma. Metabolic clearance to a pharmacologically inactive carbinol metabolite is the major elimination pathway of letrozole but is relatively slow when compared to hepatic blood flow. The cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 3A4 and 2A6 were found to be capable of converting letrozole to this metabolite in vitro but their individual contributions to letrozole metabolism in vivo have not been established. The apparent terminal elimination half-life in plasma is about 2 days. After daily administration of 2.5mg of letrozole, steady-state levels are reached within 2 to 6 weeks.","Adverse events associated with letrozole are generally mild to moderate and rarely severe enough to require discontinuation. Many can be attributed to either the underlying disease or the normal pharmacological consequence of oestrogen deprivation (hot flushes, hair thinning). The most frequently reported adverse events are musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia, headache, fatigue, nausea, dyspnoea, peripheral oedema, coughing, constipation, vomiting, chest pain, viral infection, diarrhoea, rash, abdominal pain, dyspepsia and anorexia. Dizziness, weight increase and pruritus are less commonly seen."
Lercanidipine Hydrochloride,"Lercanidipine is a selective calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine group and it inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium into smooth muscle. The mechanism of its antihypertensive action is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, thus lowering total peripheral resistance. Lercanidipine is endowed with a prolonged antihypertensive activity because of its high membrane partition coefficient and is devoid of negative inotropic effects due to its high vascular selectivity.","Treatment with Lercanidipine is generally well tolerated. The most common side effects are related to the vasodilatory properties of Lercanidipine such as flushing, peripheral edema, headache, dizziness and asthenia. Other side effects, which occurred in less than 1% of patients include fatigue; Gl disturbances such as dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain and diarrhea, polyurea, rash, somnolence and myalgia."
Lenvatinib Mesylate,"Lenvatinib is a kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR ), KIT, and RET. Lenvatinib also exhibited antiproliferative activity in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines dependent on activated FGFR signaling with concurrent inhibition of FGF-receptor substrate 2 (FRS2 ) phosphorylation.Absorption: The time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) typically occurred from 1 to 4 hours post-dose. Administration with a high-fat meal (approximately 900 calories of which approximately 55% were from fat, 15% from protein, and 30% from carbohydrates) did not affect the extent of absorption, but decreased the rate of absorption and delayed the median Tmax from 2 hours to 4 hours.Distribution: In vitro binding of Lenvatinib to human plasma proteins ranged from 98% to 99% at concentrations of 0.3 to 30 μg/mL. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0.59 to 0.61 at concentrations of 0.1 to 10 μg/mL in vitro.Metabolism: The main metabolic pathways for Lenvatinib in humans were identified as enzymatic (CYP3A and aldehyde oxidase) and non-enzymatic processes. Excretion: Ten days after a single administration of radiolabeled Lenvatinib, approximately 64% and 25% of the radiolabel were eliminated in the feces and urine, respectively.Elimination: The terminal elimination half-life of Lenvatinib was approximately 28 hours.","Hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, arterial thromboembolic events, hepatotoxicity, renal failure and impairment, proteinuria, diarrhea, fistula formation and gastrointestinal perforation, QT Interval Prolongation, hypocalcemia, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, hemorrhagic events, impairment of thyroid stimulating hormone suppression/thyroid dysfunction, wound healing complications."
Lenograstim,"Lenograstim is the glycosylated recombinant form of human granulocyte colony stimulating factor. Lenograstim accelerates neutrophil recovery significantly after chemotherapy, with beneficial effects on clinical end-points such as incidence of laboratory-confirmed infection and length of hospital stay. Chemotherapy dose intensity has also been increased in patients receiving lenograstim, notably those with breast or small cell lung cancer, although improvements in tumour response and survival have not been demonstrated. Lenograstim also assists neutrophil recovery in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, and stimulates the production of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) for autologous transfusion after aggressive chemotherapy.","Musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, splenic enlargement, nausea, fever, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, epistaxis, headache, diarrhoea, dysuria, osteoporosis, cutaneous vasculitis, anorexia, Sweet's syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis."
Lenalidomide,"Lenalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide with immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, and antineoplastic properties. Cellular activities of Lenalidomide are mediated through its target cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex. In vitro, in the presence of drug, substrate proteins (including Aiolos, Ikaros, and CK1α) are targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation leading to direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects. Lenalidomide inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of certain hematopoietic tumor cells including MM, mantle cell lymphoma, and del (5q) myelodysplastic syndromes in vitro. Lenalidomide causes a delay in tumor growth in some in vivo nonclinical hematopoietic tumor models including MM. Immunomodulatory properties of Lenalidomide include increased number and activation of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells leading to direct and enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) via increased secretion of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma, increased numbers of NKT cells, and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) by monocytes. In MM cells, the combination of Lenalidomide and Dxamethasone synergizes the inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis.Absorption: Lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Following single and multiple doses of Lenalidomide in patients with MM or MDS, the maximum plasma concentrations occurred between 0.5 and 6 hours post-dose. The single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of Lenalidomide is linear with AUC and Cmax values increasing proportionally with dose. Multiple doses of Lenalidomide at the recommended dosage does not result in drug accumulation. Administration of a single 25 mg dose of Lenalidomide with a high-fat meal in healthy subjects reduces the extent of absorption, with an approximate 20% decrease in AUC and 50% decrease in Cmax. In the trials where the efficacy and safety were established for Lenalidomide, the drug was administered without regard to food intake. Lenalidomide can be administered with or without food. The oral absorption rate of Lenalidomide in patients with MCL is similar to that observed in patients with MM or MDS.Distribution: In vitro [14 C]-Lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%. Lenalidomide is present in semen at 2 hours (1379 ng/ejaculate) and 24 hours (35 ng/ejaculate) after the administration of Lenalidomide 25 mg daily.Elimination: The mean half-life of Lenalidomide is 3 hours in healthy subjects and 3 to 5 hours in patients with MM, MDS or MCL.Metabolism: Lenalidomide undergoes limited metabolism. Unchanged Lenalidomide is the predominant circulating component in humans. Two identified metabolites are 5¬ Hydroxy-Lenalidomide and N-Acetyl Lenalidomide; each constitutes less than 5% of parent levels in circulation.Excretion: Elimination is primarily renal. Following a single oral administration of [14 C]-Lenalidomide 25 mg to healthy subjects, approximately 90% and 4% of the radioactive dose was eliminated within ten days in urine and feces, respectively. Approximately 82% of the radioactive dose was excreted as Lenalidomide in the urine within 24 hours. Hydroxy-Lenalidomide and N-Acetyl-Lenalidomide represented 4.6% and 1.8% of the excreted dose, respectively. The renal clearance of Lenalidomide exceeds the glomerular filtration rate.","Embryo-fetal toxicity, hematologic toxicity, venous and arterial thromboembolism, increased mortality in patients with CLL, second primary malignancies, hepatotoxicity, severe cutaneous reaction tumor lysis syndrome, tumor flare reactions, impaired stem cell mobilization, thyroid disorders. early mortality in patients with MCL, hypersensitivity. Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions: Lenalidomide is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) to Lenalidomide."
Leflunomide,"Leflunomide is an isoxazole immunomodulatory agent which inhibits de novo pyrimidine synthesis and has anti-proliferative activity. Following oral administration, it is rapidly metabolized to A771726, which is active in vitro and is presumed to be the active drug in vivo. Leflunomide has demonstrated prophylactic and therapeutic effects in animal models of autoimmune disease. In addition, leflunomide has exhibited anti-inflammatory and weak analgesic and antipyretic activity. In a model of experimental septicemia, leflunomide did not alter the resistance of mice to bacterial pathogens.","Adverse reactions associated with the use of leflunomide include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, respiratory infection, bronchitis, elevated liver enzymes, aggravation of pre-existing hypertension, alopecia, and rash."
Ledipasvir + Sofosbuvir,It is a fixed-dose combination tablet containing Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir for oral administration. Ledipasvir is an HCV NS5A inhibitor and Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of HCV NS5B polymerase.,"The most common adverse reactions with treatment with Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir combination for 8, 12, or 24 weeks are fatigue and headache."
Latanoprost + Timolol,"Latanoprost is an analogue of prostaglandin F2α, it reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing outflow of aqueous humour. Timolol is a non-selective adrenergic blocker. It lowers IOP by decreasing the formation of aqueous by the ciliary epithelium.","This combination is generally well tolerated. The most frequent findings of increased iris pigmentation were in patients with green-brown, yellow-brown and blue/grey/brown irides. In patients with homogeneously blue, grey, green or brown eyes, the change was only rarely seen. Darkening, thickening and lengthening of the eye lashes have been reported. The most frequently reported undesirable effects in clinical trials were irritation of the eye, including stinging, burning and ,itching, eye hyperaemia, corneal disorders, coniunctivitis blepharitis, eye pain, headache and skin rash."
Latanoprost,"Latanoprost is an analogue of prostaglandin F2α. Latanoprost is a prostanoid selective FP receptor agonist that is believed to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor. Studies in animals and man suggest that the main mechanism of action is increased uveoscleral outflow. Elevated IOP represents a major risk factor for glaucomatous field loss. The higher the level of IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss.","Eyelash changes (increased length, thickness, pigmentation, and number of lashes); eyelid skin darkening; intraocular inflammation (iritis/uveitis); iris pigmentation changes; and macular edema, including cystoid macular edema. The ocular adverse events and ocular signs and symptoms reported in 5- 15% of the patients on latanoprost in the 6 month, multicenter, double-masked, active-controlled trials were blurred vision, burning and stinging, conjunctival hyperemia, foreign body sensation, itching, increased pigmentation of the iris, and punctate epithelial keratopathy. Local conjunctiva hyperemia was observed; however, less than 1% of the latanoprost treated patients required discontinuation of therapy because of intolerance to conjunctival hyperemia."
Lasmiditan Hemisuccinate,"The acute treatment of migraine headaches has, in the past, been achieved via constriction of cerebral blood vessels, as the acute dilation of these vessels observed during migraines was thought to be the cause of the associated pain. The neurogenic hypothesis of migraine pathophysiology, an alternative to the vascular hypothesis, suggests that cerebral vasodilation is a secondary mechanism in migraine pathogenesis, and that the main contributor to migraine headache pain is the increased pathogenic firing of trigeminal nerve pathways.While the precise mechanism of action of lasmiditan is unclear, it likely supports this neurogenic hypothesis by exerting its therapeutic effects through potent and selective agonism of the 5-HT1F receptor. 5-HT1F receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system (on the central and peripheral ends of trigeminal neurons) and appear to contribute to hyperpolarization of nerve terminals and inhibition of trigeminal neuronal activity. Lasmiditan's agonism at these receptors may, therefore, inhibit the firing of trigeminal nerves responsible for migraine headache pain.Lasmiditan has virtually no affinity for other 5-HT receptor subtypes or monoamine receptors (e.g. adrenergic, dopaminergic).","The most common side effects of Lasmiditan include: dizziness, sleepiness, numbness, feeling tired, tingling."
Larotrectinib,"Larotrectinib is an inhibitor of the tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK), TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC. In a broad panel of purified enzyme assays, larotrectinib inhibited TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC with IC50 values between 5-11 nM. One other kinase TNK2 was inhibited at approximately 100-fold higher concentrations. TRKA, B, and C are encoded by the genes NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3. Chromosomal rearrangements involving in-frame fusions of these genes with various partner scan result in constitutively activated chimeric TRK fusion proteins that can act as an oncogenic driver, promoting cell proliferation and survival in tumor cell lines.Absorption: The mean absolute bioavailability of Larotrectinib capsules was 34% (range: 32% to 37%).Distribution: The mean (CV%) volume of distribution (Vss) of Larotrectinib is 48 (38%) L following intravenous administration of Larotrectinib in healthy subjects. Larotrectinib is 70% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro and binding is independent of drug concentrations. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.9.Elimination: The mean (CV%) clearance (CL/F) of Larotrectinib is 98 (44%) L/h and the half-life is 2.9 hours following oral administration of Larotrectinib in healthy subjects.Metabolism: Larotrectinib is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4. Following oral administration of a single [14C] radiolabeled 100 mg dose of Larotrectinib to healthy subjects, unchanged Larotrectinib constituted 19% and an O-linked glucuronide constituted 26% of the major circulating radioactive drug components in plasma.Excretion: Following oral administration of a single [ 14 C] radiolabeled 100 mg dose of Larotrectinib to healthy subjects, 58% (5% unchanged) of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces and 39% (20% unchanged) was recovered in urine.","Common side effects are Neurotoxicity, Hepatotoxicity."
Lapatinib,Lapatinib is a 4-anilinoquinazoline tyrosine kinase inhibitor of both Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR [ErbB1]) and Human Epidermal Receptor Type 2 (HER2 [ErbB2]) receptors. It blocks the phosphorylation and activation of downstream 2nd messengers (Erk1/2 and Akt) which regulate cellular proliferation and survival of ErbB- and ErbB2-expressing tumours.,"GI disturbances, dermatological reactions (e.g. palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, rash), fatigue, decreases in LVEF, QT interval prolongation, stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, pain in extremities, back pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, epistaxis, alopecia, nail disorders (e.g. paronychia), interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis."
Linagliptin,"Linagliptin is indicated to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4), an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). Thus, Linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta (β) cells in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the secretion of glucagon from pancreatic alpha (α) cells in the circulation.","There may be hypoglycaemia, nasopharyngitis, cough and pancreatitis in combination with metformin and sulfonylurea."
Light Liquid Paraffin + White Soft Paraffin + Glycerine,"Glycerine is an exceptionally good moisturizing, emollient and protective agent. Its ability to capture and retain water slows down the evaporation of water from the surface of the skin. It is also a humectant (wetting agent), which promotes hydration of the skin. Light Liquid Paraffin and White Soft Paraffin exert an emollient effect by forming an occlusive film that reduces trans-epidermal water loss, thus helping to maintain normal skin humidity levels.",No remarkable adverse effects have been reported.
Lifitegrast,"Lifitegrast binds to the integrin LFA-1, a cell surface protein found on leukocytes and blocks the interaction of LFA-1 with its cognate ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). ICAM-1 may be overexpressed in corneal and conjunctival tissues in DED. LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction can contribute to the formation of an immunological synapse resulting in T-cell activation and migration to target tissues. In vitro studies demonstrated that lifitegrast may inhibit Tcell adhesion to ICAM-1 in a human T-cell line and may inhibit secretion of inflammatory cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The exact mechanism of action of lifitegrast in DED is not known.","The common adverse effects are instillation site irritation, dysgeusia and reduced visual acuity. Less common are blurred vision, conjunctival hyperemia, headache, increased lacrimation, eye discharge, eye discomfort, eye pruritus and sinusitis."
Lidocaine Hydrochloride (Spray),"Lidocaine acts mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through sodium specific ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane, in particular the so called voltage-gated sodium channels. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is inhibited. The receptor site is thought to be located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Lidocaine binds more readily to sodium channels in activated state, thus onset of neuronal blockade is faster in neurons that are rapidly firing. This is referred to as state dependent blockade.","Skin rash or irritation, drowsiness, wheezing or difficulty breathing, chest pain, severe rash or itching, increased sweating, numbness."
Lidocaine Hydrochloride (Jelly),"Lidocaine acts mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through sodium specific ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane, in particular the so called voltage-gated sodium channels. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is inhibited. The receptor site is thought to be located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Lidocaine binds more readily to sodium channels in activated state, thus onset of neuronal blockade is faster in neurons that are rapidly firing. This is referred to as state dependent blockade.","Nervousness, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, drowsiness, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, hypotension, myocardial depression, bradycardia, cardiac arrest and anaphylactic reactions (cutaneous lesion, urticaria, oedema)."
Lidocaine Hydrochloride (Injection),"Lidocaine acts mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through sodium specific ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane, in particular the so called voltage-gated sodium channels. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is inhibited. The receptor site is thought to be located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Lidocaine binds more readily to sodium channels in activated state, thus onset of neuronal blockade is faster in neurons that are rapidly firing. This is referred to as state dependent blockade.","In common with other local anaesthetics, adverse reactions to lidocaine are rare and are usually the result of excessively high blood concentrations due to inadvertent intravascular injection, excessive dosage, rapid absorption or occasionally to hypersensitivity, idiosyncracy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. In such circumstances systemic effects occur involving the central nervous system and/or the cardiovascular system. CNS reactions are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by nervousness, dizziness, blurred vision and tremors, followed by drowsiness, convulsions, unconsciousness and possibly respiratory arrest. Cardiovascular reactions are hypotension, myocardial depression, bradycardia and possibly cardiac arrest. Allergic reactions are extremely rare. They may be characterized by cutaneous lesions, urticaria, oedema or anaphylactoid reactions."
Lidocaine + Prilocaine,"Lidocaine and prilocaine are local anaesthetic agents of the amide type. Both work by stabilising the neuronal membranes and inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby giving rise to the anaesthetic action.","Nervousness, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, drowsiness, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, hypotension, myocardial depression, bradycardia, cardiac arrest and anaphylactoid reactions (cutaneous lesion, urticaria, oedema)."
Lidocaine + Adrenaline,"Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic which decreases permeability of sodium ions, blocking induction and conduction of nerve impulses. Combination with epinephrine restricts systemic spread of lidocaine, vascular absorption and its duration of local anaesthetic effect.","More common side effects: Minor redness, burning, irritation, or numbness at the application site; lightheadedness; nausea.Severe side effects: Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); confusion; dizziness; fainting; fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat; loss of consciousness; mental or mood changes; nervousness; paleness; redness or warmth of skin; ringing in the ears or hearing changes; seizures; sensation of heat or cold; shortness of breath; swelling or blistering of skin; tremors or twitching; vision changes or double vision; vomiting."
Levothyroxine Sodium,"This tablet contains synthetic Levothyroxine (also called Thyroxine or T4) which is identical to the natural hormone T4, produced in the Thyroid gland. About 30% of T4 is converted to the much more active Triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. TBG (Thyroxine Binding Globulin) is the major carrier of T4. This binding protects T4 from metabolism and excretion resulting in its long half-life in the circulation. Only about 0.03% of total T4 in plasma is unbound. The half-life of elimination of T4 is 6 to 7 days. In hyperthyroidism, the half-life is shortened to 3 or 4 days, whereas in hypothyroidism it may be 9 to 10 days. In conditions associated with reduced protein in plasma as in nephrosis or hepatic cirrhosis or when binding to protein is inhibited by certain drugs the half-life of T4 may be shortened. The liver is the major site of degradation of Thyroid hormones. T4 is conjugated with Glucuronic and Sulphate conjugates through the Phenolic hydroxyl group and excreted in the urine.There is an enterohepatic circulation of the Thyroid hormones, since they are liberated by hydrolysis in the intestine and reabsorbed. Because of the long half-life of T4, a steady blood level of the biologically more active T3 can be obtained from one single daily dose of Levothyroxine. Therefore, variations in the therapeutic effect are unlikely once the correct dosage has been established.","Adverse reactions associated with Levothyroxine therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdose. They include the following:

General: Fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating;
Central nervous system: Headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia.
Musculoskeletal: Tremors, muscle weakness.
Cardiovascular: Palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure
Respiratory: Dyspnea.
Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps.
Dermatologic: Hair loss, flushing."
Levosalbutamol (Oral),"Levosalbutamol is a single isomer beta 2-agonist that differs from racemic salbutamol by elimination of (S)-salbutamol. Levosalbutamol is an effective bronchodilator whose primary mechanism of action is unimpeded by (S)-salbutamol. Thus, when compared with racemic salbutamol, clinically comparable bronchodilation can be achieved with doses that substantially lessen beta-mediated side effects.","Hypocalcaemia, palpitation, fine tremors of the skeletal muscle and muscle cramps may occur. The other likely side effects are nausea, vomiting, burning substernal or epigastric pain and diarrhoea."
Levosalbutamol,"Levosalbutamol Nebuliser Solution is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free solution of the hydrochloride salt of Levosalbutamol, the (R)-enantiomer of the drug substance racemic salbutamol. Levosalbutamol Hydrochloride is a relatively selective β2 adrenergic receptor agonist.Activation of β2 adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenylcyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP. This increase in cAMP leads to the activation of protein kinase A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in relaxation. Levosalbutamol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles. Levosalbutamol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor.","Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from beta 2 - agonist therapy. This effect may be potentiated by hypoxia. Other side effects such as palpitation, fine tremors of the skeletal muscle (particularly the hand) and muscle cramps may occur. In few cases nervousness, headache, dizziness, fatigue and sleeplessness have also been reported."
Levonorgestrel,"Oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel suppress gonadotropins, inhibiting ovulation. Specifically, levonorgestrel binds to progesterone and androgen receptors and slows the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This process results in the suppression of the normal physiological luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that precedes ovulation. It inhibits the rupture of follicles and viable egg release from the ovaries. Levonorgestrel has been proven to be more effective when administered before ovulation.","Undesirable effects which have been observed are:

Nausea and vomiting
Dizziness, fatigue, headache
Abdominal pain
A feeling of breast tenderness
Bleeding can occur after taking this medicine

Inform the doctor of any unwanted effect which is not mentioned here."
Levomilnacipran Hydrochloride,"The exact mechanism of the antidepressant action of levomilnacipran is unknown, but is thought to be related to the potentiation of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system, through inhibition of reuptake at serotonin and norepinephrine transporters. Non-clinical studies have shown that levomilnacipran is a potent and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).Levomilnacipran binds with high affinity to the human serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) transporters (Ki = 11 and 91 nM, respectively) and potently inhibits 5-HT and NE reuptake (IC50 = 16-19 and 11 nM, respectively). Levomilnacipran lacks significant affinity for any other receptors, ion channels or transporters tested in vitro, including serotonergic (5HT1-7), α- and β-adrenergic, muscarinic, or histaminergic receptors and Ca2+, Na+, K+ or Cl- channels. Levomilnacipran did not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).","Hypersensitivity

Levofloxacin Hemihydrate,"Levofloxacin is a synthetic, broad-spectrum, third generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Chemically, Levofloxacin is a chiral fluorinated carboxyquinolone. Levofloxacin exerts antibacterial action by inhibiting bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase, the enzymes required for DNA replication, transcription repair and recombination. It has in vitro activity against a wide range of gm-ve and gm+ve microorganisms.","Levofloxacin is generally well tolerated. However, a few side-effects can usually be seen. There is a risk of retinal detachment. Other side-effects include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence and rare occurrence of phototoxicity (0.1%). Side-effects that may be seen very rarely include tremors, depression, anxiety, confusion etc."
Levofloxacin (Ophthalmic),"Levofloxacin eye drops is a sterile topical ophthalmic solution. It is a synthetic, broad spectrum, third generation fluoroquinolone bactericidal antibiotic, which active against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive & Gram-negative ocular pathogens. It functions by inhibiting bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase enzymes required for DNA replication, transcription, repair and recombination.","Side effects occurred only approximately 1-3% of patients that may include transient blurred vision, fever, foreign body sensation, headache, transient ocular burning, ocular pain or discomfort, pharyngitis and photophobia. In less than 1% of patients included allergic reactions, lid edema, ocular dryness and ocular itching."
Levodopa + Carbidopa + Entacapone,"Levodopa is the metabolic precursor of dopamine. It crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain. Carbidopa increases the amount of levodopa that is transported into the CNS by inhibiting the decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. Entacapone is a selective inhibitor of COMT which alters the pharmacokinetics of levodopa, resulting to increased and more sustained levodopa serum levels.","Common side effects include dyskinesia, nausea, hyperkinesia, change in urine color, diarrhea and stomach pain. Other side effects may include diarrhea, sometimes severe; colitis; hallucinations; other mental disturbances; orthostatic hypotension; rhabdomyolysis; and symptoms resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a condition characterized by high fever, muscle stiffness, and confusion); fibrosis; skin cancer, etc."
Loteprednol Etabonate + Tobramycin,"Loteprednol is a corticosteroid which is thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Tobramycin is a member of aminoglycoside which shows bactericidal activity by inhibiting protein synthesis of bacteria.","Increased intraocular pressure, burning and stinging upon instillation, vision disorders, discharge, itching, lacrimation disorder, photophobia, corneal deposits, ocular discomfort, eyelid disorder, and other unspecified eye disorders may occur. The incidence of non-ocular adverse events (headache) also reported."
Loteprednol Etabonate + Gatifloxacin,"Loteprednol (corticosteroids) are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.Gatifloxacin is an 8-methoxyfluoroquinolone with a 3-methylpiperazinyl substituent at C7. The antibacterial action of gatifloxacin results from inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme that is involved in the replication, transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme known to play a key role in the partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division. The mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones including gatifloxacin is different from that of aminoglycoside, macrolide, and tetracycline antibiotics. Therefore, gatifloxacin may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics and these antibiotics may be active against pathogens that are resistant to gatifloxacin. Gatifloxacin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following organisms both microbiologically and clinically.Aerobic Gram-Positive Bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis group, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus pneumoniae.Aerobic Gram-Negative Bacteria: Haemophilus influenza.","Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component or the anti-infective component, or the combination. Reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated IOP, which may be associated with infrequent optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field detects, posterior sub capsular cataract formation, delayed wound healing, and secondary ocular infections from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of cornea or sclera. The most frequently reported adverse effects for gatifloxacin in the overall study population were conjunctival irritation, increased lacrimation, keratitis and papillary conjunctivitis. These events occurred in approximately 5-10% of patients. Other reported reactions occurring in 1-4% of patients were chemosis, conjunctival hemorrhage, dry eye, eye discharge, eye irritation, eye pain, eyelid edema, headache, red eye, reduced visual acuity and taste disturbance. Redness was the most commonly observed adverse event occurring in 6%. Itching, discharge photophobia and blurred vision were seen in less than 2% cases."
Loteprednol Etabonate,"Loteprednol is a corticosteroid which is thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid.","Glaucoma with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects; cataract formation; secondary ocular infection following suppression of host response; and perforation of the globe may occur."
Losartan Potassium + Hydrochlorothiazide,"Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.","Side-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)"
Losartan Potassium,"Losartan Potassium is the first non-peptide orally active angiotensin II receptor blocker. It binds to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidneys and the heart) and reduces several important biological actions including vasoconstriction and the release of aldosterone responsible for hypertension.","The side effects with the use of Losartan Potassium are mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects are dizziness, diarrhea, nasal congestion, cough, upper respiratory infection. Other side effects are fatigue, oedema, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, headache & pharyngitis."
Lorlatinib,"Lorlatinib is a kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity against ALK and ROS1 as well as TYK1, FER, FPS, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, FAK, FAK2, and ACK. Lorlatinib demonstrated in vitro activity against multiple mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, including some mutations detected in tumors at the time of disease progression on crizotinib and other ALK inhibitors. in mice subcutaneously implanted with tumors harboring EML4 fusions with either ALK variant 1 or ALK mutations, including the G1202R and 11171T mutations detected in tumors at the time of disease progression on ALK inhibitors, administration of lorlatinib resulted in antitumor activity. Lorlatinib also demonstrated anti-tumor activity and prolonged survival in mice implanted intracranially with EML4-ALK-driven tumor cell lines. The overall antitumor activity of lorlatinib in in vivo models was dose-dependent and correlated with inhibition of ALK phosphorylation.","The most frequently reported adverse reactions were hypercholesterolaemia (84.4%), hypertriglyceridaemia (67.1%), oedema (54.6%), peripheral neuropathy (47.8%), cognitive effects (28.8%), fatigue (28.1%), weight increased (26.4%) and mood effects (22.7%). Dose reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 23.4% of patients receiving Lorlatinib. The most common adverse reactions that led to dose reductions were oedema and peripheral neuropathy. Permanent treatment discontinuation associated with adverse reactions occurred in 3.1% of patients receiving Lorlatinib. The most frequent adverse reaction that led to permanent discontinuations was cognitive effects."
Lorazepam,"Lorazepam is a short-acting tranquilizer of the benzodiazepine group. It is an agonist at benzodiazepine receptors in the CNS. It exerts a depressant action on the CNS, which may be mediated by potentiating the inhibitory actions of GABA (gamma amino butyric acid) in the CNS. This will result in diminution of the ascending activating systems, particularly the serotonergic and noradrenergic pathway from brain stem or the mid-brain to the cerebral cortex.","Adverse reactions are usually observed at the beginning of therapy and generally disappeared on continued medication or upon decreasing the dose. The most frequent adverse reactions of Lorazepam are sedation followed by dizziness, weakness and unsteadiness. Less frequent adverse reactions are disorientation, depression, nausea, change in appetite, headache, sleep disturbance, agitation, dermatological symptoms, eye-function disturbance, together with various gastrointestinal symptoms and autonomic manifestations."
Loratadine + Pseudoephedrine,"Loratadine is a non-sedative histamine H1-receptor antagonist with anti-allergic properties. Loratadine is a long acting tricyclic anti-histamine with selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonistic activity and no central sedative or anti-cholinergic effect. Pseudoephedrine is an orally active sympathomimetic amine and exerts a decongestant action on the nasal mucosa. This is recognized as an effective agent for the relief of nasal congestion due to allergic rhinitis. It has nasal and bronchial decongestant activity. Pseudoephedrine is both an α-and β-adrenergic receptor agonist. It causes vasoconstriction via direct stimulation of α-adrenergic receptors of the respiratory mucosa. It also directly stimulates β-adrenergic receptors causing bronchial relaxation, increased heart rate and contractility.","In general it is well tolerated. Clinical trial suggests a very low of adverse effects commonly reported is dry mouth, somnolence, insomnia, pharyngitis, dizziness, coughing, fatigue, nausea, nervousness, anorexia, dysmenorrheal and headache. Other less common side effects may include; increased sweating, thirst, back pain, chest pain, malaise, palpitations, hypertension, tachycardia, abdominal distension, altered taste, flatulence, myalgia, dry throat, agitation, micturation frequency etc."
Loratadine,"This tablet is a preparation of Loratadine. Loratadine is a non-sedative histamine Hr receptor antagonist with antiallergic properties. Loratadine is a long-acting tricyclic antihistamine with selective peripheral Hi-receptor antagonistic activity and no central sedative or anticholinergic effect. It is rapidly effective and long-lasting, allowing once-a-day administration.","During controlled clinical studies the incidence of adverse events, including sedation and anticholinergic effects observed with 10 mg Loratadine was comparable to that observed with placebo. Studies on the effect of Loratadine on actual driving performance, and on tests of cognitive and psychomotor functioning have shown it to be comparable to placebo."
Loperamide Hydrochloride,"Loperamide Hydrochloride inhibits the peristaltic activity of the longitudinal and circular smooth muscle in the intestine by interacting with cholinergic and noncholinergic neuronal mechanisms responsible for producing the peristaltic reflex. Loperamide Hydrochloride binds to the opiate receptor in the gut wall, reducing propulsive peristalsis and increasing intestinal transit time. Loperamide Hydrochloride increases the tone of the anal sphincter. This also inhibits electrolyte and fluid secretion in the intestine.Loperamide Hydrochloride is an orally administered capsule. After administration absorption is more than 65% which occurs at a modest rate, with peak serum levels of 2-3 µgm/litre occurring at about 4 hours later after oral administration. The rest 35% is excreted unchanged in the faeces. Loperamide Hydrochloride undergoes an extensive presystemic first-pass metabolism in the gut wall and in the liver. Loperamide does not act centrally due to its high affinity for the gut wall and its presystemic metabolism. This is why it reaches the systemic circulation in a very minute amount. The route of elimination is 0.63-1.4% in urine as an unchanged drug, 58% is excreted in the bile and 15-23% appears in the faeces.","Abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal disturbances including dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue and skin rashes etc. have been reported."
Lomefloxacin (Oral),"Lomefloxacin, a difluorinated quinolone derivative, is a bacterial gyrase inhibitor, effective against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The acute toxicity of Lomefloxacin following systemic and topical ophthalmic application is low. Lomefloxacin interferes with bacterial DNA related processes like initiation, elongation, and termination phases of replication, transcription, DNA repairing, recombination, transposition, supercoiling and relaxation of DNA. The target molecule for quinolones is the A-subunit of bacterial enzyme gyrase (topoisomerase II). The forming of a stable complex between the quinolone and the whole gyrase teramer A2B2 leads to impaired enzyme functions, resulting in a rapid killing of sensitive bacteria.Cross-resistance has only been reported with other quinolones, but not with any other group of antibiotics. No clinical studies are available about the efficacy in cases of infections with chlamydia.","Common side effects are Nausea, headache, photosensitivity, dizziness, diarrhea, dry mouth, fatigue, convulsions, CNS stimulation which may lead to tremors, restlessness, light headedness, confusion & hallucinations and pseudomembranous colitis."
Lomefloxacin (Ophthalmic),"Lomefloxacin, a difluorinated quinolone derivative, is a bacterial gyrase inhibitor, effective against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The acute toxicity of Lomefloxacin following systemic and topical ophthalmic application is low. Lomefloxacin interferes with bacterial DNA related processes like initiation, elongation, and termination phases of replication, transcription, DNA repairing, recombination, transposition, supercoiling and relaxation of DNA. The target molecule for quinolones is the A-subunit of bacterial enzyme gyrase (topoisomerase II). The forming of a stable complex between the quinolone and the whole gyrase teramer A2B2 leads to impaired enzyme functions, resulting in a rapid killing of sensitive bacteria.Cross-resistance has only been reported with other quinolones, but not with any other group of antibiotics. No clinical studies are available about the efficacy in cases of infections with chlamydia.","Slight and transient burning immediately after instillation of the eye drops has been reported in 4.7% of users. Although phototoxicity has not been reported after ophthalmic use, photosensitization is possible. Since the following allergic reactions have been reported after systemic use of Lomefloxacin, they can not be excluded after topical ophthalmic use: allergic reactions, asthma, dyspnoea, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, and hypersensitization."
Lithium Carbonate,"Although lithium has been used for over 50 years in treatment of bipolar disorder, the mechanism of action is still unknown.  Lithium's therapeutic action may be due to a number of effects, ranging from inhibition of enzymes such as glycogen synthase kinase 3, inositol phosphatases, or modulation of glutamate receptors. Lithium Carbonate alters intraneuronal metabolism of catecholamines and sodium transport in neurons and muscle cells.","Tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, hands shaking, memory problems, increased thirst and consequently passing urine more often by day, and perhaps also by night."
Lisinopril,Lisinopril competitively inhibits ACE from converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II (a potent vasoconstrictor) resulting in increased plasma renin activity and reduced aldosterone (a hormone that causes water and Na retention) secretion. This promotes vasodilation and BP reduction.,"Headache, fatigue, persistent and non-productive cough, chest and abdominal pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, upper resp tract infection, asthenia, rash, orthostatic effects, hypotension, renal dysfunction, hyperkalaemia, intestinal angioedema; increased BUN and serum creatinine levels."
Liraglutide,"Liraglutide is an acylated human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37). Like endogenous GLP-1, liraglutide binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, a cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase activation through the stimulatory G-protein, Gs. Endogenous GLP-1 has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP). Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once-daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding, and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-4 and NEP.","Most common adverse reactions, reported in greater than or equal to 5% are: nausea, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, injection site reactions, headache, hypoglycemia, dyspepsia, fatigue, dizziness, abdominal pain, increased lipase, upper abdominal pain, pyrexia, and gastroenteritis"
Linezolid,"Linezolid is a synthetic, antibacterial agent belonging to a new class of antibiotics, the oxazolidinones, with in vitro activity against Gram positive aerobic bacteria, some Gram positive anaerobic bacteria and certain Gram negative bacteria. It selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis via a mechanism of action different from that of other antibacterial agents. Linezolid binds to the 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and prevents the formation of a functional 70S initiation complex which is an essential component of the bacterial translation process. The results of time-kill studies have shown Linezolid to be bacteriostatic against enterococci and staphylococci. For streptococci, Linezolid was found to be bactericidal for the majority of strains.","Most of the adverse events reported with Linezolid were mild to moderate in intensity. The most common adverse events in patients treated with Linezolid were diarrhea, headache and nausea. Other adverse events includes oral moniliasis, vaginal moniliasis, hypertension, dyspepsia, localized abdominal pain, pruritus, and tongue discoloration."
Linagliptin + Metformin Hydrochloride,"Linagliptin is indicated to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4), an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). Thus, Linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta (β) cells in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the secretion of glucagon from pancreatic alpha (α) cells in the circulation.Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",Most common side effects are nasopharyngitis and diarrhea. Hypoglycemia is more common in patients treated with this combination and sulfonylureas.
Mebendazole,Mebendazole is a synthetic broad-spectrum anthelmintic that is active against most nematodes and some other worms. Mebendazole is principally used in the treatment of intestinal nematode infection. Mebendazole inhibits the formation of the worms' microtubules and causes the worms' glucose depletion. After oral administration about 2-10% of oral dose is absorbed from Gl tract and peak plasma concentration occurs within 30 minutes to 7 hours. Mebendazole is highly bound to plasma protein. Elimination half-life is 2.8 to 9 hours.,"Gastrointestinal: Transient symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhoea in case of massive infection and expulsion of worms.
Hypersensitivity: Rash, urticaria and angioedema have been observed on rare occasions.
Central Nervous System: Very rare cases of convulsions have been reported.
Haematologic: Neutropenia and agranulocytosis."
Maprotiline Hydrochloride,The mechanism of action of maprotiline is not precisely known. It does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system and is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. The postulated mechanism of maprotiline is that it acts primarily by potentiation of central adrenergic synapses by blocking reuptake of norepinephrine at nerve endings. This pharmacologic action is thought to be responsible for the drug's antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.,"Cardiovascular: Rare occurrences of hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, palpitation, arrhythmia, heart block, and syncope have been reported with maprotiline.Psychiatric: Nervousness (6%), anxiety (3%), insomnia (2%), and agitation (2%); rarely, confusional states (especially in the elderly), hallucinations, disorientation, delusions, restlessness, nightmares, hypomania, mania, exacerbation of psychosis, decrease in memory, and feelings of unreality Neurological: Drowsiness (16%), dizziness (8%), tremor (3%), and, rarely, numbness, tingling, motor hyperactivity, akathisia, seizures, EEG alterations, tinnitus, extrapyramidal symptoms, ataxia, and dysarthria.Anticholinergic: Dry mouth (22%), constipation (6%), and blurred vision (4%); rarely, accommodation disturbances, mydriasis, urinary retention, and delayed micturition.Allergic: Rare instances of skin rash, petechiae, itching, photosensitization, edema, and drug fever.Gastrointestinal: Nausea (2%) and, rarely, vomiting, epigastric distress, diarrhea, bitter taste, abdominal cramps and dysphagia.Endocrine: Rare instances of increased or decreased libido, impotence, and elevation or depression of blood sugar levels."
Magnesium Sulfate Heptahydrate,"Magnesium is the second most plentiful cation of intracellular fluid and is involved in a wide range of activities. It is needed for activity of many enzymes and plays a role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Abnormally low concentration of magnesium in the ECF results in increased acetylcholine release and increased muscle excitability that can produce tetany. Magnesium Sulphate heptahydrate has anticonvulsant properties when administered parenterally. An increased concentration of magnesium in the ECF causes depression of the central nervous system ( CNS). Magnesium has a direct effect on skeletal muscle. Hypomagnesaemia may develop from diarrhoea, stoma or fistula, alcoholism or diuretic therapy, prolonged treatment with aminoglycosides, hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia.After administration 25-30% of magnesium is protein bound. It is excreted mainly in the urine, over 90% of magnesium filtered by the kidney is reabsorbed. Small amounts are excreted in the faeces, breast milk and saliva. Magnesium also crosses the placenta.","Excessive administration of magnesium results in hypermagnesaemia manifested by nausea, vomiting, flushing of the skin, thirst, hypotension, drowsiness, confusion, loss of tendon reflexes, respiratory depression, cardiac arrest etc"
Magnesium Sulfate,Magnesium is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions. It plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium deficiency is accompanied by a variety of different structural and functional disturbances,"The most common side effect is hypermagnesaemia developing from excessive administration of magnesium. Symptoms of hypermagnesaemia may include nausea, vomiting, flushing of skin, thirst, hypotension due to peripheral vasodilatation, drowsiness, confusion, muscle weakness etc. Rarely diarrhea or skin irritation after soaking may occur."
Magnesium Oxide,"Pharmacology: Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular divalent cation and is a cofactor for more than 300 metabolic reactions in the body. These processes include protein synthesis, cellular energy production and storage, cell growth and reproduction, DNA and RNA synthesis, and stabilization of mitochondrial membranes. Magnesium is one of the minerals responsible for managing bone metabolism, nerve transmission, cardiac excitability, neuromuscular conduction, muscular contraction, vasomotor tone, and blood pressure. Magnesium also plays a significant role in glucose and insulin metabolism, mainly through its impact on tyrosine kinase activity, phosphorylase b kinase activity, and glucose transporter protein activity. Because of these vital roles, magnesium levels may be affected by stressors to the body, such as in certain disease states. Supplementation with magnesium may have therapeutic effects in these situations.Pharmacokinetics: Absorption of a micronutrient as Mg is affected by other nutrients and reaches an estimated 30–50% of dietary Mg intake at basal conditions, while the absorption fraction declines with age and raising Mg intake. The drug absorption depends on both the kind of Mg salt and other food elements that may either augment or abate it. The distribution of Mg is mainly intracellular, <1% circulates in the blood (both extracellularly and intracellularly), and total serum Mg comprises three states with roughly 60% ionized, 33% protein-bound and 7% anion complexed. Elimination of Mg is handled by renal filtration with 25% being reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule and further 50–60% is reabsorbed in the loop of Henle. Around 70–80% of plasma Mg undergoes glomerular filtration, but merely 3% is eventually excreted in the urine.","Mild side effects include-Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Cramp, Tiredness, Weakness, Confusion. These side effects disappear when the dose is reduced or treatment is discontinued. Serious side effects include low blood pressure, changes in the recording of the heart's electrical activity (ECG), depression, severe allergic reaction (e.g. swelling in mouth and throat, itching, rash, redness), respiratory depression, coma. These may require emergency medical treatment. These serious side efects occur very rarely."
Magnesium Hydroxide + Liquid Paraffin,This preparation has a dual-relief formulation containing a gentle laxative ingredient and a lubricant which eases the discomfort associated with straining and bowel movement. It is recommended for the temporary relief of constipation,"Rectal irritation, potassium loss (thirst, weakness, nausea and diarrhea)."
Magnesium Hydroxide,"Magnesium Hydroxide is popularly known as Milk of Magnesia. It is a mildly acting antacid and laxative. It is poorly and slowly absorbed and acts by its osmotic properties in the luminal fluid which causes retention of fluid in the bowel. It is useful for emptying the bowel prior to surgical, radiological and colonoscopic procedures and can help to eliminate parasites following appropriate therapy and toxic material in some cases of poisoning. Magnesium Hydroxide is converted into Magnesium Chloride in the stomach without forming carbon dioxide",Magnesium Hydroxide in common with other magnesium salts may cause diarrhoea.
Magaldrate + Simethicone,"This is a combination of magaldrate and simethicone. Magaldrate (magnesium aluminium compound i.e. Hydroxymagnesium Aluminate), which neutralizes gastric acid extraordinarily quickly without raising the pH above 5-6. It also decreases the activity of pepsin in gastric secretion. Besides this, simethicone, the another component of Marlox Plus, enables the gas buble to coalesce and give relief from flatulence.","Gastrointestinal side-effects are uncommon. Occasionally, if excessive amount is consumed, diarrhea, constipation or regurgitation may occur."
Magaldrate,"Magaldrate is a hydroxymagnesium aluminate complex that is converted rapidly in gastric acid to Mg(OH)2 and Al(OH)3, which are absorbed poorly and thus provide a sustained antacid effect",Constipation and diarrhea may occur.
Macrogol [Polypropylene glycol] + Electrolytes,"Macrogol (3350) exerts an osmotic action in the gut, which induces a laxative effect. Macrogol (3350) increases the stool volume, which triggers colon motility via neuromuscular pathways. The physiological consequence is an improved propulsive colonic transportation of the soften stools and a facilitation of the defecation. Electrolytes combined with Macrogol (3350) are exchanged across the intestinal barrier (mucosa) with serum electrolytes and excreted without net gain or loss of sodium, potassium and water. Macrogol (3350) is unchanged along the gut. It is virtually unabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.","In the treatment of chronic constipation, diarrhoea or loose stools normally respond to a reduction in dose. Diarrhoea, abdominal distension, anorectal discomfort and mild vomiting are more often observed during the treatment for fecal impaction. Vomiting may be resolved if the dose is reduced or delayed."
Macitentan,"Endothelin (ET)-1 and its receptors (ETA and ETB ) mediate a variety of deleterious effects, such as vasoconstriction, fibrosis, proliferation, hypertrophy, and inflammation. In disease conditions such as PAH, the local ET system is upregulated and is involved in vascular hypertrophy and in organ damage. Macitentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist that inhibits the binding of ET-1 to both ETA and ETB receptors. Macitentan displays high affinity and sustained occupancy of the ET receptors in human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. One of the metabolites of macitentan is also pharmacologically active at the ET receptors and is estimated to be about 20% as potent as the parent drug in vitro. The clinical impact of dual endothelin blockage is unknown.","The most common adverse reactions (more frequent than placebo by ≥3%) are anemia, nasopharyngitis/pharyngitis, bronchitis, headache, influenza, and urinary tract infection."
Lynestrenol,"Lynestrenol is an oral preparation of the synthetic progestagen lynestrenol, which shares various activities with the natural hormone progesterone. Lynestrenol has a strong progestational influence on the endometrium. In addition, it suppresses ovulation and menstruation for as long as the preparation is taken daily without interruption. Lynestrenol can be used in conditions requiring a pronounced progestagenic effect. After oral administration lynestrenol is readily absorbed and subsequently converted into the pharmacologically active norethisterone, through which it exerts its major biological effects. Within 2-4 hours after ingestion of lynestrenol peak plasma levels of norethisterone are reached. Lynestrenol and its metabolites are predominantly excreted in the urine, and to a less extent in the faeces.","During continuous treatment regimens with Lynestrenol, breakthrough bleeding or spotting will occur frequently (over 10 per cent) during the first two months. Later on the frequency gradually decreases. During cyclic treatment regimens breakthrough bleeding and spotting will be seen occasionally (1-10 per cent). Temporarily increasing the dose will control the bleeding in most cases. Other adverse events which occur frequently (over 10 per cent) are : change in libido (both increase and decrease), nausea or other gastrointestinal disturbances, and weight increase. Adverse events which may be observed occasionally (1-10 per cent) or rare (less than 1 per cent) are : headache or migraine, dizziness, nervousness, depression, increased sweating, acne, hirsutism, chloasma, rash, pruritus, jaundice, change in lipoprotein profile, alterations in liver function tests, amenorrhoea, menstrual irregularity, reduced glucose tolerance, breast pain, oedema. Most of these adverse events are transient and of minor importance in many cases."
Lymecycline,"Lymecycline is a tetracycline derivative which blocks the access of bacterial aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex by binding to the 30S ribosome subunit, preventing the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain in protein synthesis","Lymecycline capsules may also cause the followingside effects.Common (occur in less than 1 in 10 patients):

Lurasidone Hydrochloride,The efficacy of Lurasidone in schizophrenia could be mediated through a combination of central Dopamine D2 and Serotonin 5HT2A receptor antagonism.,"Somnolence, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and nausea."
Luliconazole,"Luliconazole is a topical antifungal agent. It is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that belongs to the azole group. It acts against fungus by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol demethylase and blocks ergosterol synthesis which is an important constituent of fungal cell membrane. Thus it exerts strong fungicidal activity both in-vitro and in-vivo against dermatophytes, Candida albicans, Malassezia spp, Trichophyton and Epidermophyton spp.",Contact dermatitis and cellulitis may occur. Application site reactions were observed in iess than 1% of subjects in clinical trial.
Lubiprostone,"Lubiprostone is a locally-acting chloride-channel activator that increases intestinal secretion. In doing so, it increases intestinal motility, thus aiding the passage of stool and relieve the symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation.Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels, which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine, in a protein kinase A action independent fashion. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels causes an efflux of chloride ions into the lumen, which in turn leads to an efflux of sodium ions through a paracellular pathway to maintain isoelectric neutrality. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine. Patch clamp cell studies in human cell lines have indicated that the majority of the beneficial biological activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is observed only on the apical (luminal) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium.","Diarrhea, full or bloated feeling or pressure in the stomach, nausea, stomach pain, swelling of abdominal or stomach area, Dyspnea"
Mercaptopurine,"Mercaptopurine is a purine antagonist which is converted intracellularly into its active nucleotides, including thioinosinic acid. The nucleotides inhibit several reactions which ultimately interferes with nucleic acid synthesis and prevents the formation of RNA and DNA.","Hyperuricaemia, bone marrow toxicity, hypoplasia, anorexia, diarrhoea, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, intestinal ulceration, crystalluria with haematuria, immunosuppression, interstitial pneumonitis. Cutaneous hyperpigmentation, alopecia."

Menthol + Pramoxine Hydrochloride,"Menthol primarily activates the cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors in the skin. Menthol, after topical application, causes a feeling of coolness due to stimulation of 'cold' receptors by inhibiting Ca++ currents of neuronal membranes. It may also yield analgesic properties via kappa-opioid receptor agonism.Pramocaine reversibly binds and inhibits voltage gated sodium channels on neurons decreasing sodium permeability into the cell. This stabilizes the membrane and prevents ionic fluctuations needed for depolarization stopping any action potential propagation.Menthol and pramoxine: Each of these agents elicits local anesthetic effects.","Redness, irritation, swelling or pain."
Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine,"Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine is a freeze-dried preparation of the group-specific polysaccharide antigens from Neisseria meningitidis Group A, Group C, Group Y and Group W135.

Menaquinone-7,"Menaquinone-7 is a fat soluble vitamin which is also known as vitamin K2. Menaquinone-7 is an especial key isomer of vitamin K2 that is produced using Bacillus subtilis. Menaquinone-7 is the active trans-isomer of natural vitamin K2 with the highest bioavailability and longest half-life in blood. This makes Menaquinone-7 also available for tissues outside the liver, namely bones, arteries and soft tissues. It is a powerful cofactor in transporting excess calcium out of the arteries and depositing it into the bones thus prevents hardening of arteries. Menaquinone-7 is very essential for healthy bone and artery.","Generally well tolerated in recommended dose. From a large number of clinical trials using dosages in excess of 40 mg/day, there were no reports of side effects associated with any type of hypercoagulable state."
Memantine Hydrochloride,"Persistent activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in Central Nervous System by the excitatory amino acid glutamate has been hypothesized to contribute to the symptomatology of Alzheimer's disease. Memantine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect through its action as a low to moderate affinity as an uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels.Memantine is well absorbed after oral administration and has linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range. It is excreted predominantly unchanged in the urine and has a terminal elimination half-life of about 60-80 hours. Following oral administration, Memantine is highly absorbed with peak concentrtions reached in about 3-7 hours. Food has no effect on the absorption of Memantine. The mean volume of distribution of Memantine is 9-11 L/kg and the plasma protein binding is low (45%). emantine undergoes partial hepatic metabolism. About 48% of administered drug is excreted unchanged in urine; the remainder is converted primarily to three polar metabolites which possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity: the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy Memantine and 1-nitroso-deaminated Memantine. A total of 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N-glucuronide conjugate. The hepatic microsomal CYP-450 enzyme system does not play a significant role in the metabolism of Memantine.","Most frequent side effects (frequency of 2% or less) include hallucination, confusion, dizziness, headache and fatigue. Occasional side effects include anxiety, hypertonus (heightened muscle tension), vomiting, bladder infections and increased sexual drive. If there is a history of epileptic seizures, there is a slight chance that Memantine may increase the probability of an attack."
Memantine + Donepezil,Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules contain two approved medications: memantine hydrochloride extended-release and donepezil hydrochloride. Each of those medications is postulated to have a different mechanism in Alzheimer’s disease.Memantine: Persistent activation of central nervous system NMDA receptors by the excitatory amino acid glutamate has been hypothesized to contribute to the symptomatology of Alzheimer’s disease. Memantine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect through its action as a low to moderate affinity uncompetitive (open channel) NMDA receptor antagonist which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels. There is no evidence that memantine prevents or slows neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.Donepezil: Current theories on the pathogenesis of the cognitive signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease attribute some of them to a deficiency of cholinergic neurotransmission. Donepezil is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine in the central nervous system through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase. There is no evidence that donepezil prevents or slows neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.,"The most common adverse reactions, occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and greater than placebo with memantine hydrochloride extended-release 28 mg/day, were headache, diarrhea, and dizziness. The most common adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil and at twice or more the placebo rate, include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis."
Meloxicam,"Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam family, with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. The bioavailability of Meloxicam following oral administration is 89% on the average. With the doses of 7.5 mg & 15 mg plasma concentrations are proportional to dose: 0.4 to 1.0 mg/litre for 7.5 mg & 0.8 to 2.0 mg/litre for 15 mg, on an average. Meloxicam is very strongly bound to plasma proteins, essentially albumin (99%). Meloxicam is extensively metabolised, chiefly by oxidation of the methyl redical attached to the thiazolyl ring. Elimination in unchanged form accounts for 3% of the dose. Half of the substance is eliminated in urine & the other half in the faeces. The mean elimination half life is 20 hours.","Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation or diarrhoea may occur. Ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding may rarely occur. Skin rash, or urticaria may occur in some individuals. Oedema of the lower limbs may occur during treatment. Onset of an asthma attack has been reported in certain individuals allergic to aspirin or to other NSAIDs. Headache, vertigo or drowsiness may occur."
Melatonin,"After administration, melatonin binds with its receptors. Two types of melatonin receptor subtypes - MT1 & MT2 have been identified in humans. Melatonin receptors are found in the brain and some peripheral organs. The MT1 subtype is present in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland and the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. The MT2 subtype is mainly present in the retina. Increased level of Melatonin initiates neural & endocrine signals to optimize the levels of neurotransmitters e.g. increased serotonin, increased GABA & decreased dopamine, which induces & sustains sleep, as well as, maintains the body's circadian rhythm.",Possible adverse effects include headache and depression. Drowsiness may be experienced within 30 minutes after taking melatonin and may persist for 1 hour and thus may affect driving skills.
Megestrol Acetate,"Megestrol Acetate is a synthetic, antineoplastic and progestational drug. While the precise mechanism by which Megestrol Acetate produces its antineoplastic effects against endometrial carcinoma is unknown at the present time, inhibition of pituitary gonadotrophin production and resultant decrease in estrogen secretion may be factors. The antineoplastic action of megestrol acetate on carcinoma of the breast is effected by modifying the action of other steroid hormones and by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. In metastatic cancer, hormone receptors may be present in some tissues but not others. The receptor mechanism is a cyclic process whereby estrogen produced by the ovaries enters the target cell, forms a complex with cytoplasmic receptor and is transported into the cell nucleus. There it induces gene transcription and leads to the alteration of normal cell functions. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol acetate not only decrease the number of hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells but also are capable of modifying and abolishing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on these cells.Estimates of plasma levels of Megestrol Acetate are dependent on the measurement method used. Peak plasma concentrations occur 2 to 3 hours after a single oral dose 160 mg tablets. The plasma half-life of Megestrol Acetate is 33 to 38 hours. Approximately 66% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 20% in the faeces.","Weight Gain: Weight gain is a frequent side effect of Megestrol Acetate. This gain has been associated with increased appetite and is not necessarily associated with fluid retention.Thromboembolic Phenomena: Thromboembolic phenomena including thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism (in some cases fatal) have been reported.Glucocorticoid Effects: The glucocorticoid activity of Megestrol Acetate has not been fully evaluated. Clinical cases of new onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus, and overt Cushing’s syndrome have been reported in association with the chronic use of Megestrol Acetate. In addition, clinical cases of adrenal insufficiency have been observed in patients receiving or being withdrawn from chronic Megestrol Acetate therapy in the stressed and non-stressed state.Other: Nausea, dyspnea, tumor flare, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, alopecia, hypertension, carpal tunnel syndrome, mood changes, hot flashes, malaise, asthenia, lethargy, sweating and rash."
Mefloquine,"Mefloquine has been found to produce swelling of the Plasmodium falciparum food vacuoles. It may act by forming toxic complexes with free heme that damage membranes and interact with other plasmodial components.Mefloquine is an antimalarial agent which acts as a blood schizonticide. Mefloquine is active against the erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium species. However, the drug has no effect against the exoerythrocytic (hepatic) stages of the parasite. Mefloquine is effective against malaria parasites resistant to chloroquine. Mefloquine is a chiral molecule. According to some research, the (+) enantiomer is more effective in treating malaria, and the (-) enantiomer specifically binds to adenosine receptors in the central nervous system, which may explain some of its psychotropic effects.","Among subjects who received Mefloquine for prophylaxis of malaria, following side effects was observed:

The most frequently observed sied-effects were vomiting, dizziness, syncope, extrasystoles and other complaints affecting less than 1%. Among subjects who received Mefloquine for treatment, following side-effects was observed:
The most frequently observed side-effects included : dizziness, myalgia, nausea, fever, headache, vomiting, chills, diarrhoea, skin rash, abdominal pain fatigue, loss of appetite, and tinnitus"
Mefenamic acid,"Mefenamic acid contains Mefenamic Acid which is a nonsteroidal agent with demonstrated analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activity due to its dual action on prostaglandins. It inhibits the enzymes of prostaglandin synthetase and also antagonizes the actions of prostaglandin at the receptor sites.","The most frequently reported adverse experiences occurring in approximately 1-10% of patients are gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, flatulence, nausea, Gl ulcers, vomiting, dizziness, abnormal renal function, pruritus, rashes."
Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (Tablet),"Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses.","The following adverse reactions have been reported in women taking Medroxyprogesterone Acetate tablets, without concomitant estrogens treatment:

Genitourinary system: Abnormal uterine bleeding (irregular, increase, decrease), change in menstrual flow, breakthrough bleeding, spotting, amenorrhea, changes in cervical erosion and cervical secretions.
Breasts: Breast tenderness, mastodynia or galactorrhea has been reported.
Cardiovascular: Thromboembolic disorders including thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism have been reported.
Gastrointestinal: Nausea, cholestatic jaundice.
Skin: Sensitivity reactions consisting of urticaria, pruritus, edema and generalized rash have occurred. Acne, alopecia and hirsutism have been reported.
Eyes: Neuro-ocular lesions, for example, retinal thrombosis, and optic neuritis.
Central nervous system: Mental depression, insomnia, somnolence, dizziness, headache, nervousness."
Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (Injection),"Pharmacodynamics: Medroxyprogesterone Acetate injection has prolonged progestational effects when administered by intramuscular injection. This injection suppresses the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins which, in turns, prevents follicular maturation producing long-term anovulation in the reproductive aged women. Medroxyprogesterone Acetate injection suppresses the Leydig cell function in the male. i.e. suppresses endogenous testosterone product.Pharmacokinetics: Parenteral Medroxyprogesterone Acetate is a long acting progestational steroid. The 150 mg/ml formulation reaches half its initial concentration in about 27 days. Its long duration of acting results from its slow absorption from the injection site. The principle metabolite of medroxyprogesterone acetate that has been identified is a 6-alpha-methyl-6 beta 17 alpha, 21 trihydroxy-4-pregnene-3, 20-dione-17 acetate which is excreted in the urine.","Weight gain, feeling heaviness and pain in the abdomen, feeling pain, anxiety
Amenorrhea
Spotting
Excessive bleeding
Infection in the injected site
Headache, Blurring of vision
Pain in the back of the leg
Delay in pregnancy after withdrawing injectable contraceptive."
Mecobalamin,"Mecobalamin is the neurologically active form of vitamin B12 and occurs as a water-soluble vitamin in the body. It is a cofactor in the enzyme methionine synthase, which functions to transfer methyl groups for the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine. In anaemia, it increases erythrocyte production by promoting nucleic acid synthesis in the bone marrow and by promoting maturation and division of erythrocytes.","Generally Mecobalamin is well tolerated. However, a few side effects like GI discomfort (including anorexia, nausea or diarrhea) & rash may be seen after administration of Mecobalamin."
Meclizine Hydrochloride,"Meclizine has antiemetic, anticholinergic and antihistaminic properties. It reduces the sensitivity of the labyrinthine apparatus. The action may be mediated through nerve pathways to the vomiting center (VC) from the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), peripheral nerve pathways, the VC, or other CNS centers. Meclizine has an onset of action of 30 to 60 minutes, depending on dosage; their duration of action is 12 to 24 hours.","Common side effects are Drowsiness, dry mouth, and on rare occasions, blurred vision have been reported."
Meclizine + Pyridoxine,"Meclizine is a piperazine-derivative antihistamine that is used as an antiemetic. It has antiemetic, anticholinergic and antihistaminic properties. It reduces the sensitivity of the labyrinthine apparatus. The action may be mediated through nerve pathways to the vomiting center (VC) from the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), peripheral nerve pathways, the VC, or other CNS centers. Pyridoxine is vitamin B-6. It has been added to enhance the anti-emetic effects & as a dietary suppliment.","Drowsiness, dry mouth and, on rare occasions, blurred vision have been reported."
Mebhydrolin Napadisylate,Mebhydrolin diminishes or abolishes the main actions of histamine in the body by blocking of histamine receptors.,"Lassitude, dizziness, hypotension, muscular weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation, epigastric pain, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, depression, nightmares, anorexia, dryness of the mouth, tightness of the chest, tingling, sedation, drowsiness etc. may occur."
Metolazone,"Metolazone is a thiazide-like diuretic. It inhibits reabsorption of sodium in the distal tubules resulting in increased excretion of sodium and water, as well as potassium and hydrogen ions.","Chest pain, palpitation, necrotising angiitis, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, venous thrombosis, vertigo, volume depletion; depression, dizziness, chills, drowsiness, fatigue, restlessness, headache, lightheadedness; petechiae, photosensitivity, hypersensitivity reactions; gout attacks, electrolyte disturbances; abdominal bloating, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, epigastric distress, nausea, xerostomia, pancreatitis, vomiting; impotence; aplastic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, haemoconcentration, leukopenia; cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis; joint pain, muscle cramps, weakness, neuropathy, paraesthesia; blurred vision; increased BUN, glucosuria."
Metoclopramide Hydrochloride,"Metoclopramide blocks dopamine receptors and in higher doses, it also blocks serotonin receptors in chemoreceptor trigger zone of the CNS. It enhances the response to acetylcholine of tissue in upper GI tract causing enhanced motility and accelerated gastric emptying w/o stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. It also increases lower esophageal sphincter tone.","Most common adverse reactions (≥5%) are: dysgeusia, headache, and fatigue."
Methylprednisolone Sodium Succcinate,"Methylprednisolone, a naturally occurring glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which has also salt-retaining properties, is used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. This synthetic analog is primarily used for its potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. The intravenous injection of Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate, demonstrable effects are evident within one hour and persist for a variable period. Excretion of the administered dose is nearly complete within 12 hours. Thus, if constantly high blood levels are required, injections should be made every 4 to 6 hours. This preparation is also rapidly absorbed when administered intramuscularly and is excreted in a pattern similar to that observed after intravenous injection. Its anti-inflammatory potency is greater than prednisolone in the ratio of 5 to 4. It has only minimal mineralocorticoid properties and has less tendency than prednisolone to induce sodium and water retention. It influences carbohydrate, protein, fat and purine metabolism, electrolyte and water balance, and the functional capacities of the cardiovascular system, the kidney, the skeletal muscle, nervous system and other organs and tissues. It exerts a suppressive effect on the immune response.","Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances: Sodium retention, fluid retention, congestive heart failure in susceptible patients, potassium loss, hypokalemic alkalosis, hypertension.Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, steroid myopathy, loss of muscle mass, severe arthralgia, vertebral compression fractures, aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads, pathologic fracture of long bones, osteoporosis.Gastrointestinal: Peptic ulcer with possible perforation and hemorrhage, pancreatitis, abdominal distention, and ulcerative esophagitis.Dermatologic: Impaired wound healing, thin fragile skin, petechiae and ecchymoses, facial erythema, increased sweating, may suppress reactions to skin tests.Neurological: Increased intracranial pressure with papilledema (pseudo-tumor cerebri) usually after treatment, convulsions, vertigo, headache.Endocrine: Development of Cushingoid state, suppression of growth in children, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness, particularly in times of stress, as in trauma, surgery or illness, menstrual irregularities, decreased carbohydrate tolerance, manifestations of latent diabetes mellitus, increased requirements for insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetics.Ophthalmic: Posterior subcapsular cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, exophthalmos.Others: Negative nitrogen balance due to protein catabolism.The following additional adverse reactions are related to parenteral corticosteroid therapy: hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, subcutaneous and cutaneous atrophy, sterile abscess, anaphylactic reaction with or without circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, urticaria, nausea and vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias; hypotension or hypertension."
Methylprednisolone Acetate,"Methylprednisolone binds to and activates intracellular glucocorticoid receptors. Activated glucocorticoid receptors bind to promoter regions of DNA (which may activate or suppress transcription). Unbound glucocorticoids cross cell membranes and bind with high affinity to specific cytoplasmic receptors, modifying transcription and protein synthesis. By this mechanism, glucocorticoids can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.","Congestive heart failure in susceptible patients, hypertension, sodium retention, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer with possible subsequent and hemorrhage, abdominal distention, increased sweating, convulsion, vertigo, headache, menstrual irregularities, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, urticaria, hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation."
Methylprednisolone,"Pharmacodynamic properties: Methylprednisolone Is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with the capacity to profoundly inhibit the immune system. Glucocorticoids primarily bind to and activate intracellular glucocorticoid receptors that being activated bind to promoter regions of DMA (which may activate or suppress transcription) and activate transcription factors that result in inactivation of genes through deacetylation of histones. Methylprednisolone influences the kidney and fluid & electrolyte balance, lipid,protein, and carbohydrate metabolism, skeletal muscle, the cardiovascular system, the immune system, the nervous system, and the endocrine system.Pharmacokinetic properties: The absolute bioavailability of Methylprednisclone is generally high (82% to 89%) following oral administration and rapidly absorbed and the maximum plasma concentration is achieved around 1.5 to 2.3 hours across doses following oral administration in normal healthy adults. Methylprednisolone is widely distributed into the tissues and its volume of distribution is 41-61.5 liter. It crosses the Wood-brain barrier and the placental barrier and is secreted in breast milk. The plasma protein binding of Methylprednisolone in humans is approximately 77%. Methylprednisolone is metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. No dosing adjustments are necessary for renal failure. Methylprednisolone is haemodializable.","Short courses of Methylprednisolone are usually well-tolerated with few, mild side effects. Long term, high doses of Methyiprednisoione may produce predictable and potentially serious side effects. Whenever possible, the lowest effective doses of Methylprednisolone should be used for the shortest length of time to minimize side effects. Alternate day dosing also can help reduce side effects. Side effects of Methylprednisolone and other corticosteroids range from mild annoyances to serious irreversible bodily damage. Side effects include fluid retention, weight gain, high blood pressure, potassium loss, headache, muscle weakness, hair growth on the face, glaucoma, cataracts, peptic ulceration, growth retardation in children, convulsions, and psychic disturbances including depression, euphoria, insomnia etc. Prolonged use of Methylprednisolone can depress the ability of the body's adrenal glands to produce corticosteroids. Abruptly stopping Methylprednisolone in these individuals can cause symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, with accompanying nausea, vomiting, and even shock. Therefore, withdrawal of Methylprednisolone usually is accomplished by gradually lowering the dose. Gradually tapering Methylprednisolone not only minimizes the symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, it also reduces the risk of an abrupt flare of the disease being treated."
Methylphenidate Hydrochloride,"methylphenidate (MPH) has been shown to act as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), thereby increasing the presence of these neurotransmitters in the extraneuronal space and prolonging their action. There is a dose-related effect of psychostimulants on receptor stimulation, where higher doses are shown to increase norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) efflux throughout the brain which can result in impaired cognition and locomotor-activating effects. In contrast, low doses are found to selectively activate NE and DE neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex which is an area of the brain thought to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology, thereby improving clinical efficacy and preventing side effects. The lower doses used to treat ADHD are not associated with the locomotor-activating effects associated with higher doses and instead reduce movement, impulsivity, and increase cognitive function including sustained attention and working memory. Methylphenidate's beneficial effects in sustaining attention have also been shown to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity.Clinical findings have shown that children with ADHD have an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4), and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, suggesting a possible mode of action.","Sleep disturbances, restlessness, dizziness, headache, tremor, convulsion, rash, pruritis; urticaria, fever, arthralgia, alopecia, exfoliative, dermatitis, erythema multiforme, thrombocytopenic purpuria, thrombocytopenia, Leucopenia, urinary disorder and very rarely liver damage."
Methylergonovine Maleate,"Methylergonovine Maleate acts directly on the smooth muscle of the uterus and increases the tone, rate, and amplitude of rhythmic contractions. Thus, it induces a rapid and sustained tetanic uterotonic effect which shortens the third stage of labor and reduces blood loss. The onset of action after I.V. administration is immediate; after I.M. administration, 2-5 minutes, and after oral administration, 5­-10 minutes.","The most common adverse reaction is hypertension associated in several cases with seizure and/or headache. Hypotension has also been reported. Abdominal pain (caused by uterine contractions), nausea and vomiting have occurred occasionally. Rarely observed reactions have included: acute myocardial infarction, transient chest pains, vasoconstriction, vasospasm, coronary arterial spasm, bradycardia, tachycardia, dyspnea, hematuria, thrombophlebitis, water intoxication, hallucinations, leg cramps, dizziness, tinnitus, nasal congestion, diarrhea, diaphoresis, palpitation, rash, and foul taste. There have been rare isolated reports of anaphylaxis, without a proven causal relationship to the drug product."
Methyldopa,"Methyldopa, or α-methyldopa, is a centrally acting sympatholytic agent and an antihypertensive agent. It is an analog of DOPA (3,4‐hydroxyphenylanine), and it is a prodrug, meaning that the drug requires biotransformation to an active metabolite for therapeutic effects. Methyldopa works by binding to alpha(α)-2 adrenergic receptors as an agonist, leading to the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and reduction of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals. Methyldopa exists in two isomers D-α-methyldopa and L-α-methyldopa, which is the active form.First introduced in 1960 as an antihypertensive agent, methyldopa was considered to be useful in certain patient populations, such as pregnant women and patients with renal insufficiency. Since then, methyldopa was largely replaced by newer, better-tolerated antihypertensive agents; however, it is still used as monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Methyldopa is also available as intravenous injection, which is used to manage hypertension when oral therapy is unfeasible and to treat hypertensive crisis.","Sedation, usually transient, may occur during the initial period of therapy or whenever the dose is increased. Headache, asthenia, or weakness may be noted as early and transient symptoms. The following systemic side effects may rarely occur with the use of Methyldopa- angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, orthostatic hypotension, edema or weight gain, bradycardia, pancreatitis, colitis, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, dryness of mouth, hyperprolactinemia, bone marrow depression, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia; rheumatoid factor, hepatitis, jaundice, myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis, eosinophilia, parkinsonism, bell's palsy, nightmares and reversible mild psychoses or depression, dizziness, lightheadedness, paresthesias, arthralgia, myalgia, nasal stuffiness, rash, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, lactation, impotence. However, significant adverse effects due to Methyldopa have been infrequent and this agent usually is well tolerated."
Methyl Salicylate + Menthol + Camphor,"This cream is a specially formulated Methyl salicylate, Menthol and Camphor cream. It penetrates into skin to provide fast relief from pain and stiffness of minor arthritis and muscle aches. It alleviates pain and inflammation by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins that occur in inflamed tissues. Methyl salicylate has been shown that first pass metabolism exists in the skin and rapidly hydrolyzing salicylate ester to release the active salicylate in both epidermis and dermis. Menthol increases the penetration of drugs when applied on the skin to give a faster onset of action. It dilates the blood vessels causing a sensation of coldness followed by an analgesic effect. Camphor is a stimulant, used topically to increase local blood flow and as a 'counterirritant', which reduces pain & swelling. When in combination with other ingredients like menthol, methyl salicylate, it becomes ideal for neuralgia and other painful areas.","Redness or irritation may occur, especially in persons with sensitive skin."
Methyl Salicylate + Menthol,"This cream is a specially formulated Methyl salicylate and Menthol cream. It penetrates into skin to provide fast relief from pain and stiffness of minor arthritis and muscle aches. This cream is fast-acting, strong medicine that penetrates deep down to provide long-lasting and effective relief. Methyl salicylate has been shown that first-pass metabolism exists in the skin and rapidly hydrolyzing salicylate ester to release the active salicylate in both epidermis and dermis. It alleviates pain and inflammation by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins that occur in inflamed tissues. Menthol increases the penetration of drugs when applied on the skin to give a faster onset of action. It dilates the blood vessels causing a sensation of coldness followed by an analgesic effect.","Redness or irritation may occur, especially in persons with sensitive skin. Adverse reactions possibly involved are mild to moderate local irritation, erythema, rash, desquamation, pruritis and relative local reaction at the application site."
Methoxy Polyethylene Glycol-Epoetin Beta,"Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is a chemically synthesized continuous erythropoietin receptor activator. Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta differs from erythropoietin through integration of an amide bond between either the N-terminal amino group or the ε amino group of lysine, predominantly Lys52 and Lys45 and methoxy polyethylene glycol butanoic acid. This results in a molecular weight of approximately 60,000 daltons for methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta with the PEG-moiety having an approximate molecular weight of 30,000 daltons.In contrast with erythropoietin, methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta shows a different activity at the receptor level characterized by a slower association to and faster dissociation from the receptor, a reduced specific activity in vitro with an increased activity in vivo, as well as an increased half-life. These differential pharmacological properties are relevant in order to achieve a once monthly dosing regimen with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta in patients.Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta stimulates erythropoiesis by interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on progenitor cells in the bone marrow. As primary growth factor for erythroid development, the natural hormone erythropoietin is produced in the kidney and released into the bloodstream in response to hypoxia. In responding to hypoxia, the natural hormone erythropoietin interacts with erythroid progenitor cells to increase red cell production.","Adverse reactions are Hypertension, Vascular access thrombosis, Headache, Hypersensitivity, Hypertensive encephalopathy, Rash (maculo-papular, serious)."
Methoxsalen,"The combination treatment regimen of Psoralen (P) and UVA (Ultraviolet radiation of 320-400 nm wavelength) is commonly known as PUVA. Skin reactivity to UVA radiation is enhanced by the ingestion of Methoxsalen. The drug reaches its maximum bioavailability 1-3 hours after oral administration and may last for up to 8 hours. Methoxsalen is reversibly bound to serum albumin and is also preferentially taken up by epidermal cells. In both mice and man, Methoxsalen is rapidly metabolized. Approximately 95% of the drug is excreted as a series of metabolites in the urine within 24 hours.The exact mechanism of action of Methoxsalen with the epidermal melanocytes and keratinocytes is not known. The best known biochemical reaction of Methoxsalen is with DNA. Methoxsalen, upon photoactivation, conjugates and forms covalent bonds with DNA (both monofunctional and bifunctional). Reactions with proteins have also been described.","The most commonly reported side effect of Methoxsalen alone is nausea, which occurs with approximately 10% of all patients. This effect may be minimized or avoided by instructing the patient to take Methoxsalen with milk or food, or to divide the dose into two portions, taken approximately one-half hour apart. Other effects include nervousness, insomnia and psychological depression."
Methotrexate,"Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase. Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one-carbon groups in the synthesis of p.r.n. nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. When cellular proliferation in malignant tissues is greater than in most normal tissues, methotrexate may impair malignant growth without irreversible damage to normal tissues","Ulceration of the mouth and GI disturbances (e.g. stomatitis and diarrhoea), bone marrow depression, hepatotoxicity, renal failure, skin reactions, alopecia, ocular irritation, arachnoiditis in intrathecal use, megaloblastic anaemia, osteoporosis, precipitation of diabetes, arthralgias, necrosis of soft tissue and bone, anaphylaxis, impaired fertility."
Methocarbamol,"Methocarbamol is a central muscle relaxant for skeletal muscles, used to treat spasms. It is structurally related to guaifenesin. Methocarbamol's exact mechanism of causing skeletal muscle relaxation is unknown. It is thought to work centrally, perhaps by general depressant effects. It has no direct relaxant effects on striated muscle, nerve fibers, or the motor endplate. It will not directly relax contracted skeletal muscles. The drug has a secondary sedative effect.The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber.","Body as a whole: Anaphylactic reaction, angioneurotic edema, fever, headacheCardiovascular system: Bradycardia, flushing, hypotension, syncope, thrombophlebitisDigestive system: Dyspepsia, jaundice (including cholestatic jaundice), nausea and vomitingHemic and lymphatic system: LeukopeniaImmune system: Hypersensitivity reactionsNervous system: Amnesia, confusion, diplopia, dizziness or lightheadedness, drowsiness, insomnia, mild muscular incoordination, nystagmus, sedation, seizures (including grand mal), vertigoSkin and special senses: Blurred vision, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, metallic taste, pruritus, rash, urticaria"
Methimazole,"Methimazole inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones and thus is effective in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. The drug does not inactivate existing thyroxine and triiodothyronine that are stored in the thyroid or circulating in the blood nor does it interfere with the effectiveness of thyroid hormones given by mouth or by injection. Methimazole is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the urine.","Common: Skin rash, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, arthralgia, paresthesia, loss of taste, abnormal loss of hair, myalgia, headache, pruritus, drowsiness, neuritis, edema, vertigo, skin pigmentation, jaundice, sialadenopathy, and lymphadenopathy.Rare: Agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia, drug fever, a lupus-like syndrome, insulin autoimmune syndrome (which can result in hypoglycemic coma), hepatitis (jaundice may persist for several weeks after discontinuation of the drug), periarteritis, and hypoprothrombinemia. Nephritis occurs very rarely."
Metformin Hydrochloride,"Metformin is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.","Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Not known: Hemolytic anemiaMetabolism and nutrition disorders: Very rare: Lactic acidosis. Decrease of vitamin B12 absorption with a decrease of serum levels during long-term use of metformin. Consideration of such etiology is recommended if a patient presents with megaloblastic anemia. Cases of peripheral neuropathy in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency have been reported in post-marketing experience (frequency not known)Nervous system disorders: Common: Taste disturbance. Not known: EncephalopathyGastrointestinal disorders: Very common: Gastrointestinal disorders, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. These undesirable effects occur most frequently during the initiation of therapy and resolve spontaneously in most cases. To prevent them, it is recommended that metformin be taken in 2 or 3 daily doses during or after meals. A slow increase of the dose may also improve gastrointestinal tolerability.Hepatobiliary disorders: Very rare: Isolated reports of liver function test abnormalities or hepatitis resolving upon metformin discontinuation.Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Very rare: Skin reactions, such as erythema, pruritus, urticaria."
Mesna,"Mesna is used to prevent urothelial toxicity associated with oxazaphosphorine, ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide. It acts in the kidney; reacting with thiol groups of urotoxic metabolites (e.g. acrolein) of ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide. It is used as a mucolytic in the management of some respiratory tract conditions e.g. cystic fibrosis where other mucolytics have failed. It acts by reducing the viscosity of pulmonary secretions; the drug's free sulfhydryl group is thought to reduce disulfide linkages of mucoproteins.","Nausea, vomiting, colic, diarrhoea, anorexia, dyspepsia, unpleasant taste, constipation; headache, malaise, fatigue, depression, irritability, somnolence, hyperaesthesia, dizziness, confusion; rash, pruritus, generalised urticaria, alopecia, inj site reactions, flushing; leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, granulocytopenia, chest pain, oedema (peripheral, facial and periorbital), hypotension, tachycardia, hypertension, increased heart rate, ST-segment elevation; dyspnoea, coughing, pneumonia, tachypnea; fever; hypocalcaemia; increased sweating; back pain, limb pain, myalgia; increased hepatic enzyme concentrations; pharyngitis; ulceration of mucous membranes.

Inhalation: bronchospasm."
Mesalazine [5-aminosalicylic acid],"The mechanism of action of Mesalamine is unknown, but appears to be topical rather than systemic. Mucosal production of Arachidonic Acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, that is, prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, that is, leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with chronic infammatory bowel disease. Mesalamine diminishes infammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon.","The commonly reported adverse events are headache, nausea, dizziness, asthenia, dyspepsia, vomiting, pruritus etc."
Meropenem Trihydrate,"Meropenem is a carbapenem antibiotic for parenteral use . It exerts its bactericidal action by interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis. It penetrates bacterial cell walls, its high level of stability to all serine beta-lactamases and its marked affinity for the Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBPs.). It shows potent bactericidal activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.","Meropenem is generally well tolerated. Side effects like inflammation, thrombophlebitis, pain at the site of injection, skin reactions like rash, pruritus, urticaria, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache may occur."
Mitomycin C,Mitomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic which is enzymatically reduced to its active metabolite within susceptible cells. The active metabolite appears to cause cross-linking of DNA (primarily with guanine and cytosine pairs). It is also active against gm+ve bacteria and some viruses.,"Hemolytic uremic syndrome (<15%), Myelosuppression (64%), Nausea/ vomiting (14%), Fever (14%), Stomatitis (4%), Increased serum creatinine (2%), Mucous membrane toxicity (4%) , Fatigue, Pulmonary toxicity, Dyspnea, Cystitis, Interstitial fibrosis, Nephrotoxicity, Amenorrhea, Alopecia, Myelosuppression, haemolytic-uraemic syndrome."
Misoprostol,"Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. Maximum plasma concentrations of Misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of Misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 meg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of Misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both.","Generally, Misoprostol is well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effects associated with Misoprostol therapy involve the GI tract such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, rashes and dizziness. The incidence of diarrhea may be minimized by administering the drug after meal and at bedtime and by avoiding concomitant administration with a magnesium-containing or other laxative antacid."
Mirtazapine,"Pharmacodynamics: The mechanism of action of Mirtazapine as with other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder is unknown. Evidence gathered in preclinical studies suggests that Mirtazapine enhances central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. These studies have shown that Mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic α2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of 5- HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. Mirtazapine has no significant affinity for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of histamine (H1) receptors, a property that may explain its prominent sedative effects. Mirtazapine is a moderate peripheral α1-adrenergic antagonist, a property that may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use. Mirtazapine is a moderate antagonist at muscarinic receptors, a property that may explain the relatively low incidence of anticholinergic side effects associated with its use.Pharmacokinetics: After oral administration of Mirtazapine tablets, the active constituent mirtazapine is rapidly and well-absorbed, reaching peak plasma levels after about 2 hours. Binding of mirtazapine to plasma proteins is approximately 85%. The mean half-life of elimination is 20-40 hours; (26 hours in males, 37 hours in females). The half-life of elimination is sufficient to justify once-a-day dosing. Mirtazapine displays linear pharmacokinetics within the recommended dose range. Mirtazapine is extensively metabolized and eliminated via the urine and faeces four days. Major pathways of biotransformation are demethylation and oxidation followed by conjugation.","The most common side effects of Mirtazapine are dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, increased appetite, weight gain etc."
Mirabegron,"Mirabegron is the first beta-3 adrenoceptor agonist. Mirabegron exerts its effect via a dual mechanism, both directly acts on the bladder smooth muscle and also via the sensory nervous system, it increases the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and leads to relaxation of the detrusor smooth muscle during storage phase of urinary bladder fill-void cycle by activation of beta-3 adrenoceptor which increase bladder capacity.","The most common side effects reported for patients treated with Mirabegron 50 mg during the three 12-week phase 3 double blind, placebo controlled studies are tachycardia and urinary tract infections. The frequency of tachycardia was 1.2% in patients receiving Mirabegron 50 mg. Tachycardia led to discontinuation in 0.1% patients receiving Mirabegron 50 mg. The frequency of urinary tract infections was 2.9% in patients receiving Mirabegron 50 mg. Urinary tract infections led to discontinuation in none of the patients receiving Mirabegron 50 mg. Serious adverse reactions included atrial fibrillation (0.2%)."
Minoxidil,"Minoxidil stimulates hair growth by increasing oxygen, blood and nutrients supply to the hair follicle by widening blood vessels and inhibiting androgen hormone to affect hair follicles.Following topical application, an average of about 1.4% of the total applied dose is absorbed from the normal intact scalp. Topical Minoxidil absorption is increased by increasing the  dose applied, increasing the frequency of dosing and decreasing the barrier function of the stratum corneum. Serum Minoxidil levels and systemic effects resulting from the administration of topical Minoxidil are governed by the drug’s absorption rate through the skin. Following cessation of topical dosing, approximately 95% of the systemically absorbed drug is eliminated within 4 days. Minoxidil and its metabolites are excreted principally in the urine.",Commonly encountered side effects in clinical trials with Minoxidil topical solution were minor dermatological reactions. Dermatitis or hypertrichosis may occur. These incidences may occur in 0.1–5% of patients.
Miltefosine,"Miltefosine has demonstrated activity against Leishmania parasites and neoplastic cells primarily due to its effects on apoptosis and disturbance of lipid-dependent cell signalling pathways. Several potential antileishmanial mechanisms of action have been proposed, however no mechanism has been identified definitely. Within the mitochondria, miltefosine inhibits cytochrome-c oxidase leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis-like cell death. Antineoplastic mechanisms of action are related to antileishmanial targets and include inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and inhibition of Akt (also known as protein kinase B), which is a crucial protein within the PI3K/Akt/mTOR intracellular signalling pathway involved in regulating the cell cycle. Animal studies also suggest it may be effective against Trypanosome cruzi (the organism responsible for Chagas' disease), metronidazole-resistant strains of Trichonomas vaginalis, and it may have broad-spectrum anti-fungal activity.","Adverse reactions occurring in ≥2% of patients include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, decreased appetite, dizziness, abdominal pain, pruritus, somnolence, elevated transaminases, and elevated creatinine."
Milnacipran Hydrochloride,Milnacipran is a potent inhibitor of neuronal norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake.

Miglitol,"Miglitol reversibly inhibits membrane-bound intestinal α-glucosidase enzymes which hydrolyse oligosaccharides and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestinal brush border. It delays carbohydrate breakdown, glucose absorption and reduces postprandial hyperglycaemia.","Abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhoea, flatulence, skin rash."
Mifepristone + Misoprostol,"Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins.Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.","Mifepristone: The treatment procedure is designed to induce vaginal bleeding and uterine cramping necessary for Menstrual Regulation (MR). Commonly reported side effects were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Pelvic pain, fainting, headache, dizziness, and asthenia occurred rarely.Misoprostol: Gastro-intestinal side-effects like diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, headache, vomiting and constipation, shivering, hyperthermia, dizziness, pain due to uterine contractions, severe vaginal bleeding, shock, pelvic pain, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy and/or salpingo-oophorectomy)."
Mifepristone,"Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid which blocks the effects of progesterone by competitively binding to the intracellular progesterone receptor. It sensitises the myometrium to the contraction-inducing action of prostaglandin. At higher doses, it blocks the effect of cortisol at the glucocorticoid receptor while increasing circulating cortisol concentrations.","It is very common for women to experience uterine contractions or cramping (10-45%) in the hours following prostaglandin intake. Bleeding increases with gestational age. Heavy bleeding occurs in about 5% of cases and from 0-1.4% may require haemostatic curettage. Uterine rupture, hypotension, skin rashes, urticaria, hot flashes and dizziness have been uncommonly reported."
Midazolam,"The actions of benzodiazepines such as midazolam are mediated through the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines increase the activity of GABA, thereby producing a sedating effect, relaxing skeletal muscles, and inducing sleep, anesthesia, and amnesia. Benzodiazepines bind to the benzodiazepine site on GABA-A receptors, which potentiates the effects of GABA by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening. These receptors have been identified in different body tissues including the heart and skeletal muscle, although mainly appear to be present in the central nervous system.","At the start of therapy, drowsiness during daytime, confusion, fatigue, headache and muscle weakness may occur which usually disappear with repeated administration. Following parenteral (IV or IM) administration of Midazolam, fluctuations in vital signs have been noted including respiratory depression, apnea, variations in blood pressure and pulse rate."
Micronised Diosmin + Hesperidin,"Diosmin and Hesperidin is a phlebotonic drug and a vascular protecting agent. It reinforces venous tone by prolonging the activity of parietal noradrenaline. Thus Diosmin and Hesperidin decreases venous capacitance, venous distensibility, and venous emptying time. Diosmin and Hesperidin protects the microcirculation by fighting the microcirculation damaging process; It combats venous inflammation by decreasing leukocyte activation, and as a consequence, by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators, principally free radicals and prostaglandin. Thus Diosmin and Hesperidin normalizes capillary permeability and strengthens capillary resistance. Diosmin and Hesperidin acts on the lymphatic system, It improves lymphatic drainage by increasing lymph flow and lymph oncotic pressure.",Some cases of routine gastric disorders and neurovegetative disorders (feeling of discomfort) have been reported. In this cases discontinuation of treatment is not required.
Miconazole Nitrate + Hydrocortisone,"Miconazole is a substituted imidazole, is one of the family of azoles useful in treating the superficial candidiasis and of the skin infections dermatophytosis and pityriasis versicolor, acanthameaba, seborrhoic dermatitis. Also active against Aspergillus spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Pseudalescheria boydii and some gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococci and Streptococci. Hydrocortisone is a naturally occurring glucocorticoid that's now prepared synthetically. Its important function is in the skin injury such as inflammation. Also it has antipruritic, antimycotic and vasoconstrictive activity.Miconazole is imidazole antifungal agents that interfere with ergosterol synthesis and therefore alters the permeability of the cell membrane of sensitive fungi. Thus causes the killing of fungi, when applied to the skin, Hydrocortisone is absorbed into the skin cells. It prevents the release of certain chemicals, which is responsible for inflammation. Thus hydrocortisone reduces inflammation.",Rarely local sensitivity may occur. Long term use may decrease in the production of natural hormones by the adrenal gland.
Miconazole Nitrate (Topical),"Miconazole topical cream is a broad-spectrum antimycotic which offers a high antifungal activity against dermatophytes, yeasts and other phyco-Asco and Adelomycetes, with a potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacilli and cocci. Miconazole topical cream proved to be markedly effective in secondary infected mycoses, which under other treatments were resistant or reappeared. Miconazole topical cream does not stain skin or clothes.",Topical application of Miconazole Nitrate has almost no side effect.
Miconazole Nitrate (Oral Gel),"Pharmacodynamics: Miconazole possesses an antifungal activity against the common dermatophytes and yeasts as well as an antibacterial activity against certain gram-positive bacilli and cocci. Its activity is based on the inhibition of a demethylation step in the ergosterol biosynthesis. Ergosterol, the end-product of the biosynthetic pathway and the main sterol in yeast and fungi. The disruption in production of ergosterol disrupts the fungal cell membrane, causing holes to appear in it. These holes allow the essential constituents of the fungal cells to leak out and ultimately the fungal cells die.Pharmacokinetics: The oral bioavailability of Miconazole is low (25-30%) because there is little absorption of Miconazole from the intestinal tract. Miconazole is systemically absorbed after administration as the oral gel. Absorbed Miconazole is bound to plasma proteins (88.2%), primarily to serum albumin and red blood cells (10.6%). The absorbed portion of Miconazole oral gel is largely metabolized; less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The terminal plasma half-life is 20-25 hours in most patients. The elimination half-life of Miconazole is similar in any renal impaired patient.","Occasionally nausea and vomiting, diarrhea with long term use and rarely allergic reactions."
Metronidazole + Neomycin Sulphate + Polymyxin B + Nystatin,"Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole, is active against various anerobic bacteria and protozoa. Nystatin is a polyene antibiotic with antifungal activity. Neomycin is an aminoglycoside. It is bactericidal and active against some gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Polymyxin is active against gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","Skin rash, urticaria may occur rarely."
Metronidazole + Miconazole Nitrate,"Metronidazole is converted to reduction products that interact with DNA to cause destruction of helical DNA structure and strand leading to a protein synthesis inhibition and cell death in susceptible organisms. It is active against most anaerobic protozoa, some gm+ve, gm-ve and facultative anaerobes.Miconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis thus damaging fungal cell wall membrane and increases its permeability, allowing leakage of nutrients.","Nausea, vomiting, febrile reactions, rash, drowsiness, diarrhoea, anorexia and flushing, hepatitis. Local irritation and sensitisation, contact dermatitis."
Metronidazole,Metronidazole is a member of the imidazole class of antibacterial drug and is classified therapeutically as an antiprotozoal agent.

Studies have demonstrated that the reduced form of this drug interacts with DNA and gives bactericidal action of Metronidazole.,"Metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, drowsiness, rashes may be observed during treatment."
Metoprolol Tartrate,"Metoprolol is a selective beta1-blocker. Metoprolol reduces or inhibits the agonistic effect on the heart of catecholamines (which are released during physical and mental stress). This means that the usual increase in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac contractility and blood pressure, produced by the acute increase in catecholamines, is reduced by Metoprolol. Metoprolol interferes less with Insulin release and carbohydrate metabolism than do non-selective beta-blockers. Metoprolol interferes much less with the cardiovascular response to hypoglycaemia than do non-selective beta-blockers.","Tiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, itching or rash, shortness of breath, slow heart rate, mental confusion, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, dyspnea, Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, digestive tract disorders, heartburn, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus have also been reported, intensification of AV block."

Rarely, this medicine can cause the following in sensitive individuals: redness, burning sensation and rash. If any of these occur, stop using the gel and consult with a doctor."
Moxonidine,"Stimulation of central alpha 2-adrenergic receptors is associated with sympathoadrenal suppression and subsequent reduction of blood pressure. As this class was further explored it was discovered that sympathoadrenal activity can also be suppressed by a second pathway with a newly discovered drug target specific to imidazolines. Specifically, moxonidine binds the imidazoline receptor subtype 1 (I1) and to a lesser extent αlpha-2-adrenoreceptors in the RSV causing a reduction of sympathetic activity, reducing systemic vascular resistance and thus arterial blood pressureMoreover, since alpha-2-adrenergic receptors are considered the primary molecular target that facilitates the most common side effects of sedation and dry mouth that are elicited by most centrally acting antihypertensives, moxonidine differs from these other centrally acting antihypertensives by demonstrating only low affinity for central alpha-2-adrenoceptors compared to the aforementioned I1-imidazoline receptors","The following side effects have been reported at the approximate frequencies shown:

Very common: dry mouth, drowsiness
Common: headache, dizziness (vertigo), flushing (vasodilation), weakness or loss of strength, confusion, sleep disturbances, nausea (feeling sick), being sick (vomiting), stomach upsets (dyspepsia), diarrhoea, rash or itching (pruritus), back pain"

Molnupiravir,"Molnupiravir inhibits viral reproduction by promoting widespread mutations in the replication of viral RNA by RNA-directed RNA polymerase. It is metabolized into a ribonucleoside analog that resembles cytidine, β-D-N 4-Hydroxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (also called EIDD-1931 5′-triphosphate or NHC-TP). During replication, the virus's enzyme incorporates NHC-TP into newly-made RNA instead of using real cytidine.Molnupiravir can swap between two forms (tautomers), one of which mimics cytidine (C) and the other of which mimics uridine (U). NHC-TP is not recognized as an error by the virus' proofreading exonuclease enzymes, which can replace mutated nucleotides with corrected versions. When the viral RNA polymerase attempts to copy RNA containing molnupiravir, it sometimes interprets it as C and sometimes as U. This causes more mutations in all downstream copies than the virus can survive, an effect called viral error catastrophe or lethal mutagenesis.","Common side effects include diarrhoea, nausea, feeling dizzy, headache."
Mizolastine,"Mizolastine, a non-sedating antihistamine, blocks histamine H1-receptors on effector cells of the GI tract, blood vessels and respiratory tract.

Mycophenolate Mofetil,"Mechanism of Action: Mycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid (MPA). MPA is a potent, selective, uncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis. The mechanism by which MPA inhibits the enzymatic activity of IMPDH appears to be related to the ability of MPA to structurally mimic both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor and a catalytic water molecule. This prevents the oxidation of IMP to xanthose-5’-monophosphate which is the committed step in de novo guanosine nucleotide biosynthesis. MPA has more potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes than on other cells because T- and B lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines whereas other cell types can utilize salvage pathways.Pharmacodynamics: Mycophenolic acid, the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, is a non-competitive, reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). Inhibition of IMPDH blocks the de novo synthesis of guanosine nucleotides which are necessary substrates for DNA and RNA synthesis. Unlike other cell types which can use the salvage pathway, B and T lymphocytes are dependent upon the de novo pathway for the generation of guanosine. Data from in vitro studies indicate that mycophenolic acid and/or mycophenolate mofetil inhibit mixed lymphocyte responses and human peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation induced by a variety of mitogens and antigens. Mycophenolic acid decreases intracellular pools of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) in mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood monocytes or T lymphocytic cell lines but has no effect on GTP concentrations in human neutrophils.","The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of Mycophenolate Mofetil includes diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, gastrointestinal candidiasis, urinary tract infection, herpes simplex, vomiting and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg. opportunistic infections."

Nebivolol Hydrochloride,"Nebivolol is a β adrenergic receptor blocking agent. Nebivolol inhibits both β1 and β1 adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. At clinically relevant doses, Nebivolol does not demonstrate β1-adrenergic receptor blockade activity. Various metabolites, including glucuronides, contribute to beta-blocking activity.Mode of Action of Nebivolol involved include:

decreased heart rate
decreased myocardia contractility
diminution of tonic sympathetic outflow to the periphery from cerebral vasomotor centers
suppression of renin activity and
vasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance

Pharmacokinetics: Nebivolol is metabolized by a number of routes, including glucuronidation and hydroxylation by CYP2D6. The active isomer (d-nebivolol) has an effective half-life of about 12 hours in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (most people), and 19 hours in poor metabolizers and exposure to d-nebivolol is substantially increased in poor metabolizers. This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to b blocking activity.Absorption and Distribution: Absorption of Nebivolol is similar to an oral solution. Mean peak plasma nebivolol concentrations occur approximately 1.5 to 4 hours post-dosing in EMs and PMs. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol. Nebivolol may be administered without regard to meals. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of nebivolol is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin, and is independent of nebivolol concentrations.Metabolism and Excretion: Nebivolol is predominantly metabolized via direct glucuronidation of parent and to a lesser extent via N-dealkylation and oxidation via cytochrome P450 2D6. After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs.Digoxin: Concomitant administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 10 days in 14 healthy adult individuals resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or nebivolol.Warfarin: Administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily for 10 days) led to no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol or R- or S-warfarin following a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. Similarly, nebivolol has no significant effects on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as assessed by Prothrombin time and INR profiles from 0 to 144 hours after a single 10 mg warfarin dose in 12 healthy adult volunteers. The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No formal studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment and nebivolol should be contraindicated for these patients.","Headache, nausea and bradycardia."
Nebivolol + Hydrochlorothiazide,"The Combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone. This combination has mild vasodilating properties which reduces heart rate and blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Hydrochlorothiazide affects the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption which directly increase the excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity and increases aldosterone secretion.","Nebivolol: Headache, Dizziness, Tiredness, Diarrhoea, Constipation, Nausea etc.Hydrochlorothiazide: Vertigo, Itchiness, Rash, Increased sensitivity of skin to sunlight etc."
Nateglinide,"Nateglinide, a nonsulfonylurea hypoglycaemic agent which stimulates insulin release from the pancreatic β-cells by blocking ATP-dependent K channels, depolarising the membrane and facilitating Ca entry through Ca channels.

Natamycin,"Natamycin is a tetraene polyene antibiotic derived from Streptomyces natalensis. Natamycin probably exerts its antifungal effects by binding to sterols in the fungal cell membrane to produce a change in membrane permeability that allows loss of essential cellular constituents. It possesses in vitro activity against a variety of yeast and filamentous fungi, including Candida, Aspergillus, Cephalosporium, Fusarium and Penicillium. Although the activity against fungi is dose-related, Natamycin is predominantly fungicidal. Topical administration appears to produce effective concentration of Natamycin within the corneal stroma but not in intraocular fluid.","Eye irritation, eye discomfort, eye edema, conjunctival chemosis and hyperemia has been reported."
Naproxen Sodium + Esomeprazole Magnesium,"This consists of an immediate release Esomeprazole Magnesium layer & an enteric-coated Naproxen core. As a result, Esomeprazole is released first into the stomach, prior to the dissolution of Naproxen in the small intestine. Naproxen is a NSAID with analgesic & antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Naproxen is to inhibit the prostaglandin synthesis. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/k+ -ATPase in the gastric parietal cell by acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity.","In general, this preparation is well tolerated. The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (>5%): erosive gastritis, dyspepsia, gastritis, diarrhea, gastric ulcer, upper abdominal pain, nausea etc."
Naproxen Sodium,"Naproxen is a non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic & antipyretic properties. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and achieves 95% bioavailability.","Most frequently reported side effects include following:

Cardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.
Others: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances."
Naphazoline + Zinc Sulfate,"Zinc ions, the active compound of zinc sulphate, have an astringent, i.e. tissue-sealing and slightly anti-septic effect. Naphazoline constricts the blood vessels and reduces the inflammation and swelling of the conjunctiva. This effect of naphazoline, a substance of the benzylimidazoline group, is due to direct binding to a-adrenergic receptor sites on unstriated muscle cells in the blood vessels.","Mydriasis and a slight increase of intraocular pressure in isolated cases. A slight and transient burning sensation may occur after instillation, which does not affect the success of the treatment. Long term use may result in reactive redness of the eye (rebound effect).In very rare cases systemic cardiovascular effects, such as hypertension and arrhythmia, may occur. Nonspecific fatigue has been observed in some patients."
Naphazoline + Pheniramine,"Naphazoline, an imidazoline derivative is a sympathomimetic with α-adrenergic activity. It produces vasoconstriction. When applied topically to mucous membranes, it reduces swelling and congestion. It is often used in combination with pheniramine, an alkylamine derivative antihistamine, in ophthalmic preparations.","Blurring of vision, mild stinging and/or irritation, mydriasis and increased or decreased intraocular pressure. When used in high doses in elderly, naphazoline may liberate pigment granules from the iris."
Nandrolone Phenylpropionate,"Nandrolone Phenylpropionate is an injectable anabolic preparation. The pharmacologically active substance is nandrolone. The phenylpropionate ester gives the preparation a duration of action of about one week after injection. Nandrolone is chemically related to the male hormone. Compared to testosterone, it has an enhanced anabolic and a reduced androgenic activity. This has been demonstrated in animal bioassays and explained by receptor binding studies. The low androgenicity of nandrolone is confirmed in clinical use.In the human, Nandrolone Phenylpropionate has a nitrogen saving action. This effect on protein metabolism has been established by metabolic studies and is utilized therapeutically in conditions where a protein deficiency exists such as during chronic debilitating diseases and after major surgery and severe trauma. In these conditions, Nandrolone Phenylpropionate serves as a supportive adjunct to specific therapies and dietary measures. In women with disseminated mammary carcinoma, in selected cases Nandrolone Phenylpropionate has been reported to produce objective regressions for many months. Furthermore, Nandrolone Phenylpropionate has been shown to produce relief of bone pain in patients with osteoporosis. The similarly acting nandrolone ester, nandrolone decanoate, has been shown to increase bone mineral content in these patients. Androgenic effects (e.g. virilisation) are relatively uncommon at the recommended dosages. Nandrolone lacks the C17alpha-alkyl group which is associated with the occurrence of liver dysfunction and cholestasis.","High dosages, prolonged treatment and/or too frequent administration may cause:

Virilisation which appears in sensitive women as hoarseness, acne hirsutism and increase of libido; in prepubertal boys as an increased frequency of erections and phallic enlargement, and in girls as an increase of pubic hair and clitoral hypertrophy. Hoarseness may be the first symptom of vocal change which may end in a long-lasting, sometimes irreversible deepening of the voice.
Amenorrhoea.
Inhibition of spermatogenesis.
Premature epiphyseal closure.
Fluid retention."
Naltrexone,Naltrexone acts as a competitive antagonist at opioid receptor sites. It blocks the action of opioids and precipitates withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent individuals.,"Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting; anxiety, insomnia, lethargy, headache, musculoskeletal pain; anorexia, diarrhoea, constipation; increased thirst; chest pain; chills, dizziness; sexual dysfunction; rash, liver function abnormalities and reversible idiopathic thrombocytopenia. Inj-site reactions."
Naloxone Hydrochloride,"Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist that acts competitively at opioid receptors. While the mechanism of action of naloxone is not fully understood, the preponderance of evidence suggests that naloxone antagonizes the opioid effects by competing for the same receptor sites, especially the opioid mu receptor. Recently, naloxone has been shown to bind all three opioid receptors (mu, kappa and gamma) but the strongest binding is to the mu receptor.","Occur secondarily to reversal (withdrawal) of narcotic analgesia and sedation. Mental depression, apathy, inability to concentrate, sleepiness, irritability, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting in high oral doses during initial treatment of opiate addiction."
Nalidixic Acid,"Nalidixic acid is a synthetic narrow spectrum antibacterial. It is bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending on the concentration. Nalidixic acid appears to act by inhibiting bacterial DNA synthesis, possibly by interfering with DNA polymerization. It is rapidly and completely absorbed from the G.I. Tract. Parent drug and active metabolites are distributed to most tissues specially to the kidney and to the urine. During normal renal function, half-life is 1.1 to 2.5 hours and when renal function is impaired, half-life is up to 21 hours. It is rapidly and almost completely excreted within 24 hours.","Gastro-intestinal disturbances including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, haemolysis in G6PD deficiency, allergic reaction including urticaria, rashes, fever, arthralgia, eosinophilia, also myalgia, muscle weakness, phototoxicity, jaundice, visual disturbances and convulsions."
Nalbuphine,"Nalbuphine Hydrochloride is a synthetic potent analgesic. Its analgesic potency is essentially equivalent to that of morphine on a milligram basis. Receptor studies show that Nalbuphine binds to mu, kappa, and delta receptors, but not to sigma receptors. Nalbuphine is primarily a kappa agonist/partial mu antagonist analgesic.","Generally Nalbuphine is well tolerated. However few side-effects like sedation, sweating, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, vertigo, dry mouth, headache, respiratory depression, dyspnea and asthma may be seen."
Naftifine Hydrochloride,"Although the exact mechanism of action against fungi is not known, naftifine appears to interfere with sterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the enzyme squalene 2,3-epoxidase. This inhibition of enzyme activity results in decreased amounts of sterols, especially ergosterol, and a corresponding accumulation of squalene in the cells.",The most common adverse reaction (≥1%) is pruritus.
Naftidrofuryl Oxalate,"Naftidrofuryl oxalate possesses a 5HT2-blocking activity and counteracts both the vasoconstrictor effect and the effect promoting platelet aggregation due to serotonin. Naftidrofuryl oxalate has a direct effect on intracellular metabolism. Thus it increases ATP level, decreases lactic acid level in ischemic conditions and enhances the cellular oxidative capacity. Also, Naftidrofuryl oxalate is a powerful spasmolytic agent.","Gastrointestinal disorders (uncommon): Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain.
Renal and urinary disorders (very rare): Calcium oxalate kidney stones.
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (uncommon): Skin rash.
Hepatobiliary disorders (rare): Liver damage."
Nabumetone,"Nabumetone is a naphthylalkanone. Is is a non-selective prostaglandin G/H synthase (a.k.a. cyclooxygenase or COX) inhibitor that acts on both prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and -2). Prostaglandin G/H synthase catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 and prostaglandin G2 to prostaglandin H2. Prostaglandin H2 is the precursor to a number of prostaglandins involved in fever, pain, swelling, inflammation, and platelet aggregation. The parent compound is a prodrug that undergoes hepatic biotransformation to the active compound, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6MNA). The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis.The parent compound is a prodrug, which undergoes hepatic biotransformation to the active component, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6MNA), that is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, most likely through binding to the COX-2 and COX-1 receptors.","Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea (14%), dyspepsia (13%), abdominal pain (12%), constipation, flatulence, nausea, positive stool guaiac, dry mouth, gastritis, stomatitis, vomiting.Central Nervous System: Dizziness, headache, fatigue, increased sweating, insomnia, nervousness, somnolence.Dermatologic: Pruritus, rashSpecial Senses: TinnitusMiscellaneous: Edema"
Nab-Paclitaxel [Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel],"Nab-Paclitaxelis a microtubule inhibitor that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. Paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or ""bundles"" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.","The most common adverse reactions ( ≥20%) with single-agent use of Nab-Paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer are alopecia, neutropenia, sensory neuropathy, abnormal ECG, fatigue/asthenia, myalgia/arthralgia, AST elevation, alkaline phosphatase elevation, anemia, nausea, infections, and diarrhea.The most common adverse reactions ( ≥20%) of Nab-Paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin for non-small cell lung cancer are anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and fatigue.

The most common adverse reactions leading to withholding or delay in Nab-Paclitaxel dosing are neutropenia (41%), thrombocytopenia (30%), and anemia (16%)."
Nirmatrelvir + Ritonavir,"This inhibits the main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2. This main protease (Mpro) is also referred as 3C-like protease (3CLpro) or nsp5 protease. This inhibition of Mpro hampers the peptidomimetic activity of SARS-CoV-2. Ritonavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor but is not active against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A mediated metabolism of Nirmatrelvir, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of Nirmatrelvir","Adverse events (incidence >1% and subject difference) were dysgeusia, diarrhea, hypertension, and myalgia."
Niraparib,"Niraparib is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, PARP-1 and PARP-2, which play a role in DNA repair. In vitro studies have shown that niraparib induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes resulting in DNA damage, apoptosis and cell death. Increased Niraparib-induced cytotoxicity was observed in tumor cell lines with or without deficiencies in BRCA1/2. Niraparib decreased tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and in human patient-derived xenograft tumor models with homologous recombination deficiency that had either mutated or wild type BRCA1/2.Absorption: The absolute bioavailability of niraparib is approximately 73%. Following oral administration of Niraparib, peak plasma concentration, Cmax, is reached within 3 hours. Concomitant administration of a high fat meal (800-1,000 calories with approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal from fat) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of Niraparib.Distribution: Niraparib is 83.0% bound to human plasma proteins. The average (±SD) apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) was 1220 (±1114) L. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the Vd/F of Niraparib was 1074 L in cancer patients.Elimination: Following multiple daily doses of 300 mg Niraparib, the mean half-life (t1/2) is 36 hours. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the apparent total clearance (CL/F) of niraparib was 16.2 L/h in cancer patients.Metabolism: Niraparib is metabolized primarily by carboxylesterases (CEs) to form a major inactive metabolite, which subsequently undergoes glucuronidation.Excretion: Following administration of a single oral 300 mg dose of radio-labeled Niraparib, the average percent recovery of the administered dose over 21 days was 47.5% (range 33.4% to 60.2%) in urine and 38.8% (range 28.3% to 47.0%) in feces. In pooled samples collected over 6 days, unchanged Niraparib accounted for 11% and 19% of the administered dose recovered in urine and feces, respectively","In the pivotal ENGOT-OV16 study, adverse reactions (ADRs) occurring > 10% of patients receiving Niraparib monotherapy were nausea, thrombocytopenia, fatigue/asthenia, anaemia, constipation, vomiting, abdominal pain, neutropenia, insomnia, headache, decreased appetite, nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, dyspnea, hypertension, dyspepsia, back pain, dizziness, cough, urinary tract infection, arthralgia, palpitations, and dysgeusia. The most common serious adverse reactions >1% (treatment-emergent frequencies) were thrombocytopenia and anaemia."
Nintedanib,"Nintedanib is a small molecule, competitive, triple angiokinase inhibitor that targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs). Many of these RTKs are implicated in lung fibrosis and tumour angiogenesis, so nintedanib is therefore used in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-small cell lung cancer, and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease. The specific RTKs that nintedanib inhibits are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) α and β, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-3, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and Fns-Like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3). Nintedanib binds to the ATP-binding pocket of these receptors and inhibits their activity, thereby blocking signalling cascades that result in the proliferation and migration of lung fibroblasts. Nintedanib also inhibits kinase signalling pathways in various cells within tumour tissues, including endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and cells contributing to angiogenesis, culminating in an inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis of affected tumour cells.In addition to RTK inhibition, nintedanib also prevents the actions of the nRTKs Lck, Lyn, and Src. The contribution of the inhibition of Lck and Lyn towards the therapeutic efficacy of nintedanib is unclear, but inhibition of the Src pathway by nintedanib has been shown to reduce lung fibrosis.","Summary of the safety profile: Nintedanib has been studied in clinical trials of 1,529 patients suffering from IPF. The safety data provided in the following are based on the two Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 1,061 patients comparing treatment with Nintedanib 150 mg twice daily to placebo for 52 weeks (INPULSIS-1 and INPULSIS-2) and based on data observed during the post-marketing period.The most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with the use of Nintedanib included diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, weight decreased and hepatic enzyme increased.Tabulated list of adverse reactions: The below table provides a summary of the adverse reactions by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and frequency category.Below table summarizes the frequencies of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that were reported in the Nintedanib group (638 patients) pooled from the two placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials of 52 weeks duration or from the post-marketing period.Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)."
Nimodipine,Nimodipine inhibits inflow of Calcium ions into cells by blocking Calcium channels or select voltage-sensitive areas resulting in relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. Nimodipine has greater action on the cerebral vessels because of its high lipophilicity.,"Although side effects from nimodipine are not common, the following can occur: headache, dizziness, flushing (feeling of warmth), heartburn, fast heartbeat, slow heartbeat, upset stomach, stomach pain, constipation, depression etc."
Nimesulide,"Nimesulide is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, and analgesic properties. It inhibits prostaglandin synthetase/cyclooxygenase, which limits prostaglandin production. Its cyclooxygenase inhibiting potency is intermediate, but is relatively selective for the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) thus the potential for gastric injury and intolerance is less. It is also a free radical scavenger, and helps protect against the tissue damage that occurs during inflammation.","Epigastric discomfort, heartburn or abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea; skin rash, pruritus, oedema, headache, dizziness, drowsiness; hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. bronchospasm, rhinitis, angioedema urticaria); GI haemorrhage/perforation; bullous/erosive stomatitis, purpura, thrombocytopenia, toxic epidermal necrolysis, haematuria, oliguria, and renal failure; increases in liver enzymes."
Nilotinib,"Pazopanib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-1 and -3, cytokine receptor (Kit), interleukin-2 receptor-inducible T- cell kinase (Itk), lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), and transmembrane glycoprotein receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Fms). In vitro, Pazopanib inhibited ligand-induced autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2, Kit, and PDGFR receptors.Absorption: Pazopanib is absorbed orally with the median time to achieve peak concentrations of 2 to 4 hours after the dose. Daily dosing at 800 mg results in geometric mean AUC and Cmax of 1,037 mcg/mL and 58.1 mcg/mL (equivalent to 132 μM), respectively. There was no consistent increase in AUC or Cmax at Pazopanib doses above 800 mg.Distribution: Binding of Pazopanib to human plasma protein in vivo was greater than 99% with no concentration dependence over the range of 10 to 100 mcg/mL. In vitro, studies suggest that Pazopanib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP.Metabolism: In vitro studies demonstrated that Pazopanib is metabolized by CYP3A4 with a minor contribution from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8.Elimination: Pazopanib has a mean half-life of 30.9 hours after administration of the recommended dose of 800 mg. Elimination is primarily via feces with renal elimination accounting for less than 4% of the administered dose.","Rash, pruritus, hepatotoxicity, headache, fever, fatigue, GI disturbances (nausea, constipation, diarrhoea), alopecia, asthenia, muscle spasms, arthralgia, myalgia, pain (e.g. musculoskeletal or chest pain), oedema, folliculitis, papilloma, insomnia, dizziness, vertigo, anxiety, paraesthesia, hyperhidrosis, dry skin, urticaria, acne, conjunctivitis, dry eye, flushing, dyspnoea, cough, myelosuppression (e.g. thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia), thrombotic disorders or haemorrhage, arrhythmias, heart failure, pericarditis, palpitations, HTN, angina, MI; elevated AST/ALT, serum lipase; electrolyte imbalances."
Nikethamide,Nikethamide was formerly used as a respiratory stimulant but its use for this indication is no longer recommended as the effective doses are close to those causing toxic effects (especially convulsions).,"The following is a list of possible side-effects that may occur from all constituting ingredients of Nikethamide Injection: Skin irritation, Eye irritation, Respiratory irritation."
Nifedipine,Nifedipine is an inhibitor of Calcium Channel Blocker that blocks the transmembrane influx of Calcium ions into muscle cells. Nifedipine has selective effects as a dilator of arterial vessels. Nifedipine dilates main coronary and systemic arteries. As a result blood pressure falls and this elicits a sympathetic reflex response causing tachycardia and an increased cardiac output. Pulmonary arterial pressure also falls. Nifedipine has direct negative inotropic effects on cardiac muscles and these effects are seen at higher doses than dose which causes arterial vasodilatation.,"Headache, flushing, lethargy, gravitational oedema rash, nausea, increased frequency of micturation, eye pain, gum hyperplasia, depression, tremor, photosensitivity and few cases of jaundice have been reported. These reactions may regress on discontinuation of therapy. Its introduction may induce attacks of ischaemic pain in some patients with angina pectoris."
Nicotinic Acid [Niacin],"Niacin is a preparation of Nicotinic acid. It is proven effective at lowering VLDL, LDL, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels while raising HDL levels. So Niacin has been prescriped for the treatment of cardiovascular disease particularly the hyperlipidemias.","Niacin is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions have been mild and transient. The most frequent advers effects were flushing, itching, pruritis, nausea and GI upset, jaundice, hypotension, tachycardia, increased serum blood glucose and uric acid levels, myalgia."
Nicorandil,"Nicorandil dilates arterioles and large coronary arteries by opening the potassium channels, and stimulates guanylate cyclase causing venous vasodilatation. It therefore reduces preload and afterload, and improves coronary blood flow.","Headache (usually transitory), flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and weakness. Hypotension and reflex tachycardia at high doses."
Nevirapine,Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that acts against HIV-1. It binds directly to reverse transcriptase and thereby blocks the RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities by disrupting the enzyme's catalytic site.,"Skin rash, nausea, vomiting, headache, abnormal LFT, fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain."
Netarsudil Dimesylate,"Netarsudil is a Rho kinase inhibitor, works at the cellular level within the trabecular outflow pathway to relax actin-myosin. This causes relaxation within the trabecular meshwork and the inner wall of Schlemm's canal and decreases episcleral venous pressure (EVP).","The most common ocular adverse reaction observed in controlled clinical studies with Netarsudil was conjunctival hyperemia, corneal verticillata, instillation site pain, corneal staining and blurred vision."
Netarsudil + Latanoprost,"This is a fixed-dose combination of a Rho kinase inhibitor and a Prostaglandin F2 analogue. Netarsudil is a Rho kinase inhibitor, works at the cellular level within the trabecular outflow pathway to relax actin-myosin. This causes relaxation within the trabecular meshwork and the inner wall of Schlemm's canal, and decrease episcleral venous pressure (EVP).Latanoprost is a selective FP receptor agonist which reduces the intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor through uveoscleral outflow.","The most common ocular adverse reaction observed in controlled clinical studies with Netarsudil & Latanoprost was conjunctival hyperemia, instillation site pain, corneal verticillata, instillation site discomfort, foreign body sensation and blurred visions were reported in few patients."
Neratinib,"Neratinib is a kinase inhibitor that irreversibly binds to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), and HER4. In vitro, Neratinib reduces EGFR and HER2 autophosphorylation, downstream MAPK and AKT signaling pathways, and showed antitumor activity in EGFR and/or HER2 expressing carcinoma cell lines. Neratinib human metabolites M3, M6, M7 and M11 inhibited the activity of EGFR, HER2 and HER4 in vitro. In vivo, oral administration of Neratinib inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenograft models with tumor cell lines expressing HER2 and EGFR.Absorption: The Neratinib and major active metabolites M3, M6 and M7 peak concentrations are reached in the range of 2 to 8 hours after oral administration.Distribution: In patients, following multiple doses of Neratinib, the mean (%CV) apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss/F) was 6433 (19%) L. In vitro protein binding of Neratinib in human plasma was greater than 99% and independent of concentration. Neratinib bound predominantly to human serum albumin and human alpha-1 acid glycoprotein.Elimination: Following 7 days of daily 240 mg oral doses of Neratinib in healthy subjects, the mean (%CV) plasma half-life of Neratinib, M3, M6, and M7 was 14.6 (38%), 21.6 (77%), 13.8 (50%) and 10.4 (33%) hours, respectively. The mean elimination half-life of Neratinib ranged from 7 to 17 hours following a single oral dose in patients. Following multiple doses of Neratinib at once daily 240 mg in cancer patients, the mean (%CV) CL/F after first dose and at steady state (day 21) were 216 (34%) and 281 (40%) L/hour, respectively.Metabolism: Neratinib is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO).Excretion: After oral administration of 200 mg (0.83 times of approved recommended dosage) radiolabeled neratinib oral formulation, fecal excretion accounted for approximately 97.1% and urinary excretion accounted for 1.13% of the total dose. Sixty one percent of the excreted radioactivity was recovered within 96 hours and 98% was recovered after 10 days.","Diarrhea, Hepatotoxicity."
Nepafenac,"Nepafenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory prodrug (NSAID). After instillation in the eye, it penetrates the cornea and is converted by ocular tissue hydrolase to Amfenac, a potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Amfenac is thought to inhibit the action of cyclooxygenase enzyme. This enzyme is required for prostaglandin synthesis.","Reported side effects are foreign body sensation, lid margin crusting, ocular discomfort, ocular hyperemia etc."
Neostigmine Methyl Sulphate,"Neostigmine is a parasympathomimetic, specifically, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor. By interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, Neostigmine indirectly stimulates both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. It does cross the blood-brain barrier but only poorly. Neostigmine binds to the anionic site of cholinesterase. The drug blocks the active site of acetylcholinesterase; so the enzyme can no longer break down the acetylcholine molecules before they reach the postsynaptic membrane receptors. This allows for the threshold to be reached so a new impulse can be triggered in the next neuron. In myasthenia gravis there are too few acetylcholine receptors. So with the acetylcholinesterase blocked, acetylcholine can bind to the few receptors and trigger a muscular contraction.","Nausea, vomiting, increased salivation, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps (more marked with high doses). Signs of overdose are increased gastrointestinal discomfort, bronchial secretions and sweating, involuntary defecation and micturition, miosis, nystagmus, bradycardia, hypotension, agitation, excessive dreaming and weakness eventually leading to fasciculation and paralysis."
Neomycin Sulphate + Polymyxin B Sulphate + Pramoxine,"This cream is a combination of Neomycin, Polymyxin B and Pramoxine HCl. Neomycin is bactericidal for many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. It is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis by binding with ribosomal RNA and causing misreading of the bacterial genetic code. Polymyxin B is bactericidal for a variety of gram-negative organisms. It increases the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane by interacting with the phospholipids components of the membrane. Pramoxine is an external analgesic that provides temporary relief of pain or discomfort.","Topical antibiotics, particularly Neomycin sulphate, may cause cutaneous sensitization. The manifestations of sensitization to topical antibiotics are usually itching and reddening. When used in small doses, no common side effects have been reported with this product."
Neomycin Sulfate + Bacitracin Zinc + Polymyxin B Sulfate (Ophthalmic),"Neomycin, an aminoglyoside with antimicrobial spectrum similar to gentamicin, binds to the 30S subunits of the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis and thereby disrupting DNA synthesis. It is active against many gram-negative aerobes and against some strains of staphylococci.Bacitracin, on the other hand, inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis and is active against many gram-positive bacteria (e.g. staphylococci, streptococci, corynebacteria and Clostridia) and some gram-negative species (e.g. Neisseria and Haemophilus influenzae). They are often found in combinations in topical preparations as broad spectrum antibacterial agents.Polymyxin B disrupts the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane of mostly gm-ve organisms allowing leakage of intracellular constituents by binding to membrane phospholipids.","Rash, itching, burning, anaphylactic reactions, swelling, conjunctival erythema."
Neomycin Sulfate + Bacitracin Zinc + Polymyxin B Sulfate,"The combination of Polymyxin B sulfate with Neomycin and Bacitracin zinc most nearly meets the criteria for an ideal topical antibacterial preparation. The spectrum of action encompasses virtually all pathogenic bacteria found topically and the three antibiotics are bactericidal. When used topically Polymyxin B sulphate with Neomycin and Bacitracin zinc are rarely irritating, and absorption from the skin or mucous membrane is insignificant. Polymyxin B sulphate attacks gram-negative bacilli including clinically isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This organism is conspicuously absent from the spectra of most other antibiotic agents, but it is highly susceptible to polymyxin B sulphate, which is acknowledged to be the most effective agent known for the treatment and prophylaxis of Pseudomonas infections. Neomycin provides bactericidal action against various gram-positive organisms and gram-negative organisms including many strains of Proteus. Neomycin is considered by various authorities to be the most effective antibiotic against Staphylococcus aureus which is among the more common aetiological organisms in topical bacterial infections. Bacitracin zinc is highly active against gram-positive bacilli and cocci and extends the spectrum to include haemolytic streptococci, thus completing the anti-bacterial range of this Ointment. There is overlapping of the bactericidal spectra of these three antibiotics, thereby providing increased activity through combined antibiotic action.","Common side effects are Nausea; Vomiting; Pain, burning, or swelling; Skin rashes; Possible kidney problems; Hearing loss; Dizziness; Unusual numbness of the skin; Muscle twitching; Seizures; Pain; Redness; Swelling at the injection site."
Neomycin Sulfate + Bacitracin Zinc,"Bacitracin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis and is active against many gram-positive bacteria (e.g. staphylococci, streptococci, corynebacteria and Clostridia) and some gram-negative species (e.g. Neisseria and Haemophilus influenzae). They are often found in combinations in topical preparations as broad spectrum antibacterial agents.Neomycin, an aminoglyoside with antimicrobial spectrum similar to gentamicin, binds to the 30S subunits of the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis and thereby disrupting DNA synthesis. It is active against many gram negative aerobes and against some strains of staphylococci.","This preparation is usually well tolerated. In rare cases, allergic reactions may be occurred."
Obeticholic Acid,"Obeticholic Acid is an agonist for FXR, a nuclear receptor expressed in the liver and intestine. FXR is a key regulator of bile acid, inflammatory, fibrotic, and metabolic pathways. FXR activation decreases the intracellular hepatocyte concentrations of bile acids by suppressing de novo synthesis from cholesterol as well as by increased transport of bile acids out of the hepatocytes. These mechanisms limit the overall size of the circulating bile acid pool while promoting choleresis, thus reducing hepatic exposure to bile acids.","The most common side effects of Obeticholic Acid include: Pruritus, Fatigue & Stomach pain and discomfort. Other common side effects include rash, arthralgia (joint pain), oropharyngeal pain (pain in the middle part of the throat), dizziness, constipation, abnormal thyroid function, and eczema (inflammation of the skin)."
Nystatin (Topical),"Nystatin has fungistatic or fungicidal activity against variety of pathogenic and nonpathogenic yeast and fungi, including Candida albicans. Nystatin exerts its antifungal activity by binding to sterols in the fungal cell membrane. As a result of binding, the membrane is no longer able to function as a selective barrier, and potassium and other cellular constituents are lost. It is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.","The frequency of adverse events reported in patients using nystatin cream is less than 0.1%. The more common events that were reported include allergic reactions, burning, itching, rash, eczema, and pain on application."
Nystatin (Oral),"Nystatin is an antifungal antibiotic. Which has fungistatic or fungicidal activity against variety of pathogenic and nonpathogenic yeast and fungi, including Candida albicans. Nystatin exerts its antifungal activity by binding to sterols in the fungal cell membrane. As a result of binding, the membrane is no longer able to function as a selective barrier, and potassium and other cellular constituents are lost. It is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.","Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have occasionally been reported with high doses of Nystatin. No systemic effects or allergic reactions have been associated with its oral dose."
Nortriptyline,"Nortriptyline, a dibenzocycloheptadiene tricyclic antidepressant, is the primary active metabolite of amitriptyline. It increases synaptic concentration of serotonin and/or norepinephrine in the CNS by blocking the neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.","The most common side effects include dry mouth, sedation, constipation and increased appetite, mild blurred vision, tinnitus, often euphoria and mania. An occasional side effect is a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Alcohol may exacerbate some of its side effects and should be avoided."
Norgestrel + Ethinyl Estradiol + Ferrous Fumarate,"Combination oral contraceptives (COC) act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).","Edema, Weakness, Amenorrhea, Breakthrough bleeding, Change in menstrual flow, Spotting, Anorexia, DVT, Thrombophlebitis, Depression, Dizziness, Headache, Nervousness, Somnolence, B reast tenderness, Galactorrhea, Abdominal pain, Nausea, Vomiting, Change in weight, Cholestatic jaundice"
Norgestrel,"Progestin-only oral contraceptives such as Norgestrel tablets prevent conception by suppres sing ovulation in approximately half of the cycles in users, thickening the cervical mucus to inhibit sperm penetration, lowering the midcycle LH and FSH peaks, slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallopian tubes, and altering the endometrium. Serum progestin levels peak about two hours after oral administration, followed by rapid distribution and elimination. By 24 hours after drug ingestion, serum levels are near baseline, making efficacy dependent upon rigid adherence to the dosing schedule. There are large variations in serum levels among individual users. Progestin-only administration results in lower steady-state progestin levels and a shorter elimination half-life than concomitant administration with estrogens.","An increased risk of the following adverse reactions has been reported with the use of progestin-only oral contraceptives: Delayed follicular atresia/ovarian cysts, Menstrual irregularity, changes in menstrual flow; breakthrough bleeding/spotting; amenorrhea, prolonged bleeding. The following adverse reactions were reported in ≥5% of subjects in the Norgestrel Tablet clinical studies:

Headache
Dizziness
Nausea
Increased appetite
Abdominal pain, cramps and bloating
Fatigue
Vaginal discharge
Dysmenorrhea
Nervousness
Backache
Breast discomfort
Acne"
Norethisterone Acetate,"Norethisterone tablet is a preparation of Norethisterone which has progestational actions similar to those of progesterone, but is a more potent inhibitor of ovulation and has weak estrogenic and androgenic properties. It is used to treat a number of disorders of the menstrual cycle. Norethisterone is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and its effects last for at least 24 hours. It is excreted in the urine.","Side-effects are more common during the first months after start of intake of Norethisterone, and subside with a duration of treatment. The side-effects are mentioned below:

Eye disorders- Visual disturbance
GI disorders- Nausea
General disorders and administration site- conditions headache, edema
Nervous system disorders- Migraine, Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders- Dyspnoea,
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- Hypersensitivity (eg. Rash, urticaria)."
Norepinephrine,"Norepinephrine is a direct-acting sympathomimetic which stimulates β1- and α-adrenergic receptors. Its α-agonist effects cause vasoconstriction, thereby raising systolic and diastolic BP with reflex slowing of heart rate.","Body as a whole: Ischemic injury due to potent vasoconstrictor action and tissue hypoxia. Cardiovascular System: Bradycardia, probably as a reflex result of a rise in blood pressure, arrhythmias.Nervous System: Anxiety, transient headache. Respiratory System: Respiratory difficulty.Skin and Appendages: Extravasation necrosis at injection site. Prolonged administration of any potent vasopressor may result in plasma volume depletion which should be continuously corrected by appropriate fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy. If plasma volumes are not corrected, hypotension may recur when Norepinephrine is discontinued, or blood pressure may be maintained at the risk of severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction (e.g., decreased renal perfusion) with diminution in blood flow and tissue perfusion with subsequent tissue hypoxia and lactic acidosis and possible ischemic injury. Gangrene of extremities has been rarely reported. Overdoses or conventional doses in hypersensitive persons (e.g., hyperthyroid patients) cause severe hypertension with violent headache, photophobia, stabbing retrosternal pain, pallor, intense sweating, and vomiting."
Nizatidine,"Nizatidine is a competitive, reversible inhibitor of histamine at the histamine H2-receptors, particularly those in the gastric parietal cells. By inhibiting the action of histamine on stomach cells, nizatidine reduces stomach acid production. Nizatidine had no demonstrable antiandrogenic action. Full-dose therapy for the problems treated by nizatidine lasts no longer than 8 weeks. It has been demonstrated that treatment with a reduced dose of nizatidine is effective as maintenance therapy following healing of active duodenal ulcers.","Headache, dizziness, insomnia, abnormal dreams, somnolence, asthenia, anxiety, excessive sweating, diarrhoea, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain/discomfort, constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, dry mouth, anorexia, tooth disorder, urticaria, rash, pruritus, exfoliative dermatitis, anaemia, rhinitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, reversible hepatocellular injury, diaphoresis, myalgia, fever. Rarely, asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia, thrombocytopenic purpura, decreased libido, gynaecomastia, reversible cholestatic or mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular injury with jaundice."
Nivolumab,"Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.Combined nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) mediated inhibition results in enhanced T-cell function that is greater than the effects of either antibody alone, and results in improved anti-tumor responses in metastatic melanoma and advanced RCC. In murine syngeneic tumor models, dual blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 resulted in increased anti-tumor activity.","Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) in patients were:

As a single agent: fatigue, rash, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, diarrhea, nausea, asthenia, cough, dyspnea, constipation, decreased appetite, back pain, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, headache, abdominal pain, and vomiting.
In combination with ipilimumab: fatigue, diarrhea, rash, pruritus, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, cough, decreased appetite, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspnea, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, headache, hypothyroidism, decreased weight, and dizziness.
In combination with ipilimumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy: fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, diarrhea, rash, decreased appetite, constipation, and pruritus.
In combination with cabozantinib: diarrhea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, palmar-plantarerythrodysaesthesia syndrome, stomatitis, rash, hypertension, hypothyroidism,musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, nausea, dysgeusia, abdominal pain, cough,and upper respiratory tract infection.
In combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy: peripheral neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, constipation, and musculoskeletal pain."
Nitroglycerin (Sublingual Tablet),"Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle and result in vasodilatation.","Headache which may be severe and persistent may occur immediately after use. Vertigo, dizziness, weakness, palpitation and other manifestations of postural hypotension may develop occasionally."
Nitroglycerin (Sublingual Spray),"The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, producing a vasodilator effect on both peripheral arteries and veins with more prominent effects on the latter. Dilation of the post-capillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (pre-load). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after-load).","A number of nitrate related adverse effects may occur including headache, facial flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feelings of weakness, postural hypotension and reflex tachycardia ."
Nitroglycerin (Oral preparation),"Nitroglycerin causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, producing a vasodilator effect on both peripheral arteries and veins. Dilation of veins promote peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload) and relaxation of arteries reduce systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload).","Headache may occur at the onset of treatment but will usually subside after a few days. If the headache persists dosage should be decreased. Other side effects include tachycardia, postural hypotension and syncope, cyanosis and methaemoglobinaemia."
Nitroglycerin (Ointment),"The principal pharmacologic action of glyceryl trinitrate is mediated via the release of nitric oxide. When glyceryl trinitrate ointment is applied by the intra-anal route,the internal anal sphincter becomes relaxed.Hypertonicity of the internal but not the external anal sphincter is a predisposing factor in the formation of anal fissures.",Headache and dizziness is a common side effect experienced with Nitroglycerin 0.4% ointment. A possible side effect is reduced control over bowel movements and leaking of bowel motions although this is expected to be a rare event.
Nitroglycerin (IV Infusion),"The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance,systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (after load). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs.","Adverse reactions to nitroglycerin are generally dose-related and almost all of these reactions are the result of nitroglycerin's activity as a vasodilator. Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of lightheadedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been reported but are uncommon. Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia in normal-seeming patients. Methemoglobinemia is so infrequent at these doses that further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment is deferred."
Nitrofurazone,Nitrofurazone is a broad spectrum topical antibacterial agent indicated for the treatment of mixed skin infections of superficial wounds and diseases of the skin.,Sensitization and generalized allergic skin reactions may be produced after few days of initial application. Cross sensitization to other Nitrofurazone derivatives may occur. Intolerance to Nitrofurazone necessitating withdrawal has been encountered.
Nitrofurantoin + Nitrofurantoin Microcrystals,"Each capsule contains two forms of nitrofurantoin. Twenty-five percent is macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin, which has slower dissolution and absorption than nitrofurantoin monohydrate. The remaining 75% is nitrofurantoin monohydrate contained in a powder blend which, upon exposure to gastric and intestinal fluids, forms a gel matrix that releases nitrofurantoin over time. This capsule is highly soluble in urine, to which it may impart a brown color. When administered with food, the bioavailability of nitrofurantoin is increased by approximately 40%.","In clinical trials of Macrobid, the most frequent clinical adverse events that were reported as possibly or probably drug related were nausea (8%), headache (6%), and flatulence (1.5%)"
Nitrofurantoin,"Nitrofurantoin is an antibacterial agent specific for urinary tract infections. Nitrofurantoin is highly soluble in urine, to which it may impart a brown color. Nitrofurantoin inactivates or alters bacterial ribosomal proteins and other macromolecules.

Gram-Negative Aerobes- Escherichia coli, Citrobacter amalonaticus, Citrobacter diversus, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae.","The most frequent clinical adverse events are nausea, headache, and flatulence. Other less occurred adverse events are diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, emesis, dizziness and drowsiness."
Nitrazepam,"Nitrazepam is a benzodiazepine with a pronounced sleep-inducing activity. It depresses the reticular-activating system in the brainstem by enhancing the inhibitory effect of GABA on brain cells, thus preventing excessive brain activity.","Hypotension, palpitation; agitation, aggressiveness, amnesia, ataxia, confusion, delusions, disorientation, dizziness, fatigue, hallucination, hangover, headache, irritability, nightmares, psychoses, rage, restlessness, sedation; rash; changes in libido; constipation, diarrhoea, excessive salivation, heartburn, nausea, vomiting; granulocytopenia, leukopenia; falling, muscle weakness; blurred or double vision; tinnitus (associated with withdrawal); aspiration, increased bronchial secretion, dyspnoea."
Nitazoxanide,"Nitazoxanide is a synthetic antiprotozoal agent for oral administration. The antiprotozoal activity of Nitazoxanide is believed to be interference with the Pyruvate Ferredoxin Oxido Reductase (PFOR) enzyme-dependant electron transfer reaction. This reaction is essential for anaerobic energy metabolism of the protozoa. Nitazoxanide and its metabolites, tizoxanid are active in vitro in inhibiting the growth of sporozoites and oocyst of Cryptosporidium parvum and trophozoites of Giardia lamblia.","The most frequent side effects, reported by Nitazoxanide are abdominal pain, vomiting and headache. These side effects are typically mild and transient in nature. Very rare side effects include- nausea, anorexia, flatulence, increased appetite, enlarged salivary glands, increased creatinine & SGPT level, pruritus, rhinitis, sweating, dizziness, discolored urine etc."
Oral Rehydration Salt [Flavored],"Potassium chloride is a major cation of the intracellular fluid. It plays an active role in the conduction of nerve impulses in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle; contraction of cardiac skeletal and smooth muscles; maintenance of normal renal function, acid-base balance, carbohydrate metabolism and gastric secretion.Sodium chloride is the major extracellular cation. It is important in electrolyte and fluid balance, osmotic pressure control and water distribution as it restores sodium ions. It is used as a source of electrolytes and water for hydration, treatment of metabolic acidosis, priming solution in haemodialysis and treatment of hyperosmolar diabetes.It is also used as diluents for infusion of compatible drug additives.Dextrose is a monosaccharide that is used as a source of calories and water for hydration. It helps to reduce loss of body protein and nitrogen. It also promotes glycogen deposition in the liver. When used with insulin, it stimulates the uptake of potassium by cells, especially in muscle tissue, thus lowering serum potassium levels.Sodium bicarbonate raises blood and urinary pH by dissociation to provide bicarbonate ions, which neutralises the hydrogen ion concentration. It also neutralises gastric acid via production of carbon dioxide.",No significant side effects.
Oral Polio Vaccine,"Parenteral inactivated poliovirus vaccine(IPV) chiefly induces formation of serum antibody. Infection, with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) or wild poliovirus, also induces development of secretory IgA antibody. In addition, infection results in virus shedding and, hence, in possible spread of virus to contacts (more likelywith wild than with vaccine virus). IPV induces a high level (90%–95%) of protection against disease, which presumably is mediated by serum antibody that prevents CNS invasion resulting from viremia. IPV induces little protection against infection but does modify the related virus shedding- chiefly that from the oropharynx. Infection, whether by OPV or wild virus, induces a high level of protection against disease. It also results in appreciable prevention or modification of infection because of the developmentof secretoryIgA antibody. This effect is directly protective for the vaccinee and also benefits the community, since the exposed vaccinee can play little or no part in the spread of wild virus. One major question remaining concerns the maintenance of immunity. Lifelong immunologic memory assures an enhanced serum antibody response to any infection that occurs, but will it be sufficiently rapid that when preinfection antibody cannot be detected newly formed antibody will block blood-borne viral invasion of the CNS? If not, booster doses of vaccineare indicated. OPV boosters might be indicated in any case to reinforce protection against infection and so maintain herd immunity.",Paralysis (very rarely reported)
Ondansetron,"Ondansetron is a potent, highly selective 5HT3 receptor-antagonist. Its precise mode of action in the control of nausea and vomiting is not known. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy may cause release of 5HT in the small intestine initiating a vomiting reflex by activating vagal afferents via 5HT3 receptors. Ondansetron blocks the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a release of 5HT in the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and this may also promote emesis through a central mechanism. Thus, the effect of ondansetron in the management of the nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is probably due to antagonism of 5HT3 receptors on neurons located both in the peripheral and central nervous system. The mechanisms of action in post-operative nausea and vomiting are not known but there may be common pathways with cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting.","Frequently reported adverse events were headache, constipation and diarrhea, but the majority have been mild or moderate in nature. In chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving Ondansetron. There also have been reports to a sensation of flushing or warmth, hiccups and liver enzyme abnormalities. Rare cases of anaphylaxis, brochospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, shortness of breath have also been reported, except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to Ondansetron is unclear. There have been no evidence to extrapyramidal reactions, in rare case oculogyric crisis appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions without definitive clinical evidence. In case of PONV, with the exception of headache, rates of these events were not significantly different in the Ondansetron and placebo groups."
Omeprazole,"Omeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, is an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.","Omeprazole is generally well tolerated. Nausea, abdominal colic, paresthesia, dizziness and headache have been stated to be generally mild and transient and not requiring a reduction in dosage."
Omega-3 Acid Ethyl Esters [Salmon Fish Oil],"Omega-3-acid ethyl esters reduce triglyceride production by the liver but this mechanism is not well understood. Omega-3-acid ethyl esters inhibit acyl-CoA: 1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase, reducing triglyceride synthesis and increasing paroxysmal beta-oxidation, which increases fatty aside metabolism. Omega-3-acid ethyl esters also inhibit the release of fatty acids by competing for enzymes involved in the synthesis of triglycerides, increase triglyceride clearance by increasing the activity of lipoprotein lipase, and decrease production of VLDL-C.","Adverse events are rarely reported such as dyspepsia, nausea, constipation, gastritis, dizziness etc."
Omalizumab,"Asthma and Nasal Polyps: Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) on the surface of mast cells, basophils, and dendritic cells, resulting in FcεRI down-regulation on these cells. In allergic asthmatics, treatment with omalizumab inhibits IgE-mediated inflammation, as evidenced by reduced blood and tissue eosinophils and reduced inflammatory mediators, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU): Omalizumab binds to IgE and lowers free IgE levels. Subsequently, IgE receptors (FcεRI) on cells down-regulate. The mechanism by which these effects of omalizumab result in an improvement of CSU symptoms is unknown.","Asthma: The most common adverse reactions (≥1% of patients) in clinical studies with adult and adolescent patients ≥12 years of age were arthralgia, pain (general), leg pain, fatigue, dizziness, fracture, arm pain, pruritus, dermatitis, and earache. In clinical studies with pediatric patients 6 to <12 years of age, the most common adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis, headache, pyrexia, upper abdominal pain, pharyngitis streptococcal, otitis media, viral gastroenteritis, arthropod bites, and epistaxis.Nasal Polyps: The most common adverse reactions (≥3% of patients) in clinical studies with adult patients included the following: headache, injection site reaction, arthralgia, upper abdominal pain, and dizziness.Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria: The most common adverse reactions (≥2% of patients) included the following: nausea, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, viral upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, headache, and cough."

Olopatadine is devoid of effects on alpha adrenergic, dopamine and muscarinic type 1 and 2 receptors. Following topical ocular administration in human, olopatadine was shown to have low systemic exposure.","Headaches have been reported at an incidence of 7%. The following adverse experiences have been reported in less than 5% of patients: Asthenia, blurred vision, burning or stinging, cold syndrome, dry eye, foreign body sensation, hyperemia, hypersensitivity, keratitis, lid edema, nausea, pharyngitis, pruritus, rhinitis, sinusitis, and taste perversion"
Olopatadine Hydrochloride (Nasal Spray),"Olopatadine, an antihistamine, works by blocking the action of histamine in the body, which reduces allergy symptoms. Olopatadine Hydrochloride treats sneezing, itching, runny nose, and other nasal symptoms of allergies. Olopatadine Nasal Spray contains 0.6% w/v Olopatadine (base) in a nonsterile aqueous solution with pH of approximately 3.7. After initial priming (5 sprays), each metered spray from the nasal applicator delivers 100 microliters of the aqueous solution containing 665 mcg of olopatadine Hydrochloride, which is equivalent to 600 mcg of Olopatadine (base). Olopatadine Nasal Spray also contains benzalkonium chloride (0.01%), dibasic sodium phosphate, edetate disodium, sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide (to adjust pH), and purified water.","A bitter taste in the mouth, nosebleeds, or irritation/soreness in the nose may occur. Drowsiness may rarely occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly."
Olmesartan Medoxomil + Hydrochlorothiazide,"Angiotensin-II formed from angiotensin-I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin-II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In-vitro-binding studies indicate that Olmesartan is a reversible & competitive inhibitor of AT 1 receptor. Olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase-I, the enzyme that converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrades bradykinin).Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases Aldosterone secretion & urinary Potassium loss and decreases serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin-II. So, co-administration of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.","The common side-effects are nausea, headache, dizziness, hyperuricemia, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection. Other adverse effects are chest pain, back pain, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, diarrhea."

Olaparib,"Olaparib is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, including PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3. PARP enzymes are involved in normal cellular homeostasis, such as DNA transcription, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair. Olaparib has been shown to inhibit growth of select tumor cell lines in vitro and decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer both as monotherapy or following platinum-based chemotherapy. Increased cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity following treatment with olaparib were noted in cell lines and mouse tumor models with deficiencies in BRCA. In vitro studies have shown that olaparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complex, resulting in disruption of cellular homeostasis and cell death.","The most common serious adverse reaction reported was anemia (2.4% olaparib vs 2.2% chemotherapy). The following serious ADRs were reported in one patient each: dermatitis allergic, neutrophil count decreased and platelet count decreased. The proportion of patients who permanently discontinued Olaparib due to adverse events was 4.9% in the Olaparib arm compared with 7.7% in the chemotherapy arm. Anemia and platelet count decrease were the only adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of Olaparib in more than one patient."
Olanzapine,"Olanzapine is an antipsychotic agent and has affinities for serotonin 5HT2A/2C, 5HT3, 5HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors M1-M5; α1 adrenergic; and histamine H1 receptors. The mechanism of action of Olanzapine, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug’s efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours. The absorption is not affected by food. Olanzapine is not mutagenic or clastogenic as well as not carcinogenic.","Very common undesirable effects are somnolence and weight gain.

Oxyphencyclimine Hydrochloride,"Oxyphencyclimine binds the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. It may block all three types of muscarinic receptors including M-1 receptors in the CNS and ganglia, M-2 receptors in the heart (vagus) and M-3 receptors at the parasympathetic NEJ system. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptors mediate various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins. Oxphencyclimine inhibits vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine. This in turn reduces the secretion of gastric acids in the stomach.","Xerostomia, decreased sweating, urinary hesitancy and retention, blurred vision, cycloplegia, increased ocular tension, loss of taste, headache, nervousness, mental confusion, impotence, suppression of lactation, urticaria, constipation."
Oxymorphone Hydrochloride,"Oxymorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxymorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with oxymorphone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.","General Disorders: Respiratory depression, Fatigue, Asthenia.Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Anorexia.Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, Bradycardia, Palpitations.Eye Disorders: Miosis, Diplopia, Blurred vision.Gastrointestinal Disorders: Vomiting, Constipation.Psychiatric Disorders: Dysphoria, Euphoric mood, Nervousness, Restlessness, Insomnia, Agitation, Hallucination, Depression.Vascular Disorders: Hypotension & Flushing."

Osimertinib,"Osimertinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that binds to certain mutant forms of EGFR (T790M, L858R, and exon 19 deletion) that predominate in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours following treatment with first-line EGFR-TKIs. As a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, osimertinib is specific for the gate-keeper T790M mutation which increases ATP binding activity to EGFR and results in poor prognosis for late-stage disease. Furthermore, osimertinib has been shown to spare wild-type EGFR during therapy, thereby reducing non-specific binding and limiting toxicity.","Common side effects are Interstitial Lung Disease or Pneumonitis, QTc Interval Prolongation, Cardiomyopathy, Keratitis"
Oseltamivir,"Oseltamivir is a prodrug of oseltamivir carboxylate. Oseltamivir carboxylate inhibits neuraminidase (sialidase), a viral surface enzyme which is responsible for the replication and infectivity of influenza virus A and B, thereby preventing the release of viruses from infected cells.","The most frequently reported adverse events are nausea and vomiting. These events generally of mild to moderate degree and usually are occurred on the first 2 days of administration. Additional adverse events occurring in <1% of patients receiving Oseltamivir for treatment include unstable angina, anemia, pseudomembranous colitis, humerus fracture, pneumonia, pyrexia, and peritonsillar abscess."
Ornidazole,Ornidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole derivative active against protozoa and anaerobic bacteria. It is converted to reduction products that interact with DNA to cause destruction of helical DNA structure and strand leading to a protein synthesis inhibition and cell death in susceptible organisms.,"Side effects of Ornidazole have been mainly limited to the gastrointestinal tract (nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain) and central nervous system (dizziness, headache, lassitude). Unlike other nitroimidazoles, Ornidazole does not interact with alcohol, although this requires further study.Leukopenia has been described occasionally during therapy. Adverse central nervous system (CNS) effects of Ornidazole have mainly included headache, dizziness, lassitude or somnolence, fatigue and weakness. Adverse CNS effects of Ornidazole may be less than that happens with metronidazole. Seizures have not been reported with Ornidazole in studies available to date."
Orlistat,"Orlistat is a potent, specific and long-acting lipase inhibitor. It exerts its therapeutic activity in the lumen of the stomach and upper small intestine by forming a covalent bond with the active serine site of gastric and pancreatic lipases. The inactivated enzyme is thus rendered unable to hydrolyze dietary fats in the form of triglycerides into absorbable free fatty acids and monoglycerides. As undigested triglycerides can not be absorbed, a caloric deficit arises which has a positive effect on weight control. Systemic absorption of orlistat is therefore not needed for the activity. At the recommended therapeutic dose of 120 mg three times a day, orlistat inhibit dietary fat absorption by approximately 30%.","Common: Undesirable effects of Orlistat are largely gastrointestinal in nature. Common gastrointestinal side effects are oily spotting from the rectum, flatulence, fecal urgency, oily or fatty stool, abdominal discomfort etc.Rare: Influenza, anxiety. headache, fatigue etc may rarely occur in some patients. Rare cases of hypersensitivity have been reported. Main clinical symptoms are pruritus, exanthema, urticaria, angioedema and anaphylaxis."
Pefloxacin Mesylate Dihydrate,"Pefloxcin is a synthetic antibacterial agent, belongs to fluoroquinolone group. It exerts its action by inhibiting the subunit-A of DNA gyrase (Topoisomerase II). Pefloxcin is bactericidal and has a broad spectrum of activity.","Occasionally observed reactions are - Gastrointestinal disturbance: Epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia. Central nervous system disturbance: Headache, insomnia. Hypersensitivity reaction: Skin rash, pruritis, photosensitization. Others: Myalgia and/or arthralgia, tendonitis, rupture of achilles tendon."
Pazopanib Hydrochloride,"Pazopanib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR 2, VEGFR-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-α and -β, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-1 and -3, cytokine receptor (Kit), interleukin-2 receptor-inducible T-cell kinase (Itk), lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), and transmembrane glycoprotein receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Fms). In vitro, Pazopanib inhibited ligand-induced autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2, Kit, and PDGFR-β receptors.Absorption: Pazopanib is absorbed orally with median time to achieve peak concentrations of 2 to 4 hours after the dose. Daily dosing at 800 mg results in geometric mean AUC and C max of 1,037 mcg/mL and 58.1 mcg/mL (equivalent to 132 µM), respectively. There was no consistent increase in AUC or C max at Pazopanib doses above 800 mg.Distribution: Binding of Pazopanib to human plasma protein in vivo was greater than 99% with no concentration dependence over the range of 10 to 100 mcg/mL. In vitro, studies suggest that Pazopanib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP.Metabolism: In vitro studies demonstrated that Pazopanib is metabolized by CYP3A4 with a minor contribution from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8.Elimination: Pazopanib has a mean half-life of 30.9 hours after administration of the recommended dose of 800 mg. Elimination is primarily via feces with renal elimination accounting for less than 4% of the administered dose.","Common side effects of Pazopanib include:

Hepatic Toxicity and Hepatic Impairment
QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes
Cardiac Dysfunction
Hemorrhagic Events
Arterial and Venous Thromboembolic Events
Thrombotic Microangiopathy
Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula
Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome
Hypertension
Hypothyroidism
Proteinuria
Tumor Lysis Syndrome
Infection
Increased Toxicity with Other Cancer Therapy"
Paroxetine Hydrochloride,"The efficacy of Paroxetine is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine, 5 HT). Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. In vitro radioligand binding studies indicate that paroxetine has little affinity for muscarinic, alpha1, alpha2, beta adrenergic, dopamine (D2), 5-HT1, 5 HT2 and histamine (H1)-receptors; antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic and alpha1-adrenergic receptors has been associated with various anticholinergic, sedative and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs. Because the relative potencies of paroxetine’s major metabolites are at most 1/50 of the parent compound, they are essentially inactive.","Major depressive disorder: Asthenia, sweating, nausea, decreased appetite, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, tremor, nervousness, ejaculatory disturbance and other male genital disorders.Obsessive compulsive disorder: Nausea, dry mouth, decreased appetite, constipation, dizziness, somnolence, tremor, sweating, impotence and abnormal ejaculation.Panic disorder: Asthenia, sweating, decreased appetite, decreased libido , tremor, abnormal ejaculation, female genital disorders and impotence.Social anxiety disorder: Sweating, nausea, dry mouth, constipation, decreased appetite, somnolence, tremor, decreased libido, yawn, abnormal ejaculation, female genital disorders and impotence.Generalised anxiety disorder: Asthenia, infection, constipation, decreased appetite, dry mouth, nausea, decreased libido, somnolence, tremor, sweating and abnormalejaculation.Post-traumatic stress disorder: Asthenia, sweating nausea, dry mouth, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, somnolence, decreased libido, abnormal ejaculation, female genital disorders and impotence."
Paricalcitol,"Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion.","The most common adverse reactions (>5% and more frequent than placebo) include diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, vomiting, hypertension, hypersensitivity, nausea, and edema."
Parecoxib,"Parecoxib is a prodrug of valdecoxib. Valdecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor within the clinical dose range. Cyclooxygenase is responsible for generation of prostaglandins. Two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, have been identified. COX-2 is the isoform of the enzyme that has been shown to be induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli and has been postulated to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. COX-2 is also involved in ovulation, implantation and closure of the ductus arteriosus, regulation of renal function, and central nervous system functions (fever induction, pain perception and cognitive function). It may also play a role in ulcer healing. COX-2 has been identified in tissue around gastric ulcers in man but its relevance to ulcer healing has not been established.The difference in antiplatelet activity between some COX-1 inhibiting NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors may be of clinical significance in patients at risk of thrombo-embolic reactions. COX-2 selective inhibitors reduce the formation of systemic (and therefore possibly endothelial) prostacyclin without affecting platelet thromboxane. The clinical relevance of these observations has not been established.","Commonside effects are-

Change in your blood pressure (up or down)
You may get back pain
Ankles, legs and feet may swell (fluid retention)
You may feel numb- your skin may lose sensitivity to pain and touch
You may get vomiting, stomach ache, indigestion, constipation, bloating and wind
Tests may show abnormal kidney function
You may feel agitated or find it hard to sleep
Dizziness
There is a risk of anaemia- changes in red blood cells after an operation that may cause fatigue and breathlessness
You may get a sore throat or difficulty breathing (shortness of breath)
Your skin may be itchy
You may pass less urine than usual.
Dry socket (inflammation and pain after a tooth extraction)
Increased sweating
Low levels of potassium in blood test results."
Paracetamol + Tramadol Hydrochloride,"Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M1 to μ-opioid receptors. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics.These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.","The following adverse reactions may happen to this therapy: asthenia, fatigue, hot flushes, dizziness, headache, tremor, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, anxiety, confusion, euphoria, insomnia, nervousness, somnolence pruritus, rash, increased sweating etc."
Paracetamol + Caffeine,"This is a combination of Paracetamol and Caffeine. Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Caffeine is an alkaloid which is a theophylline-like xanthine derivative. By intermolecular association with Paracetamol, Caffeine increases the solubility and transmembrane permeation of Paracetamol. In addition, Caffeine increases the pain threshold and tolerance of pain. Caffeine has also an intrinsic power to raise vessel tone in the brain, which provides another benefit to treat migraine and headache.","Side effects of paracetamol are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally."
Paracetamol (IV Infusion),"Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat dissipation.","As all paracetamol products, adverse drug reactions are rare (>1/10000, <1/1000) or very rare (<1/10000). Frequent adverse reactions at injection site have been reported during clinical trials (pain and burning sensation). Very rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions ranging from simple skin rash or urticaria to anaphylactic shock have been reported and require discontinuation of treatment. Cases of erythema, flushing, pruritus and tachycardia have been reported."
Pantoprazole Sodium Sesquihydrate,"Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to the H+/K+ATPase enzyme system at the surface of the gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus that persists longer than 24 hours.","Pantoprazole is well tolerated in both short-term and long-term treatment. Headache and diarrhea are the common side effects and rarely included side effects are abdominal pain, flatulence, rash, insomnia and hyperglycemia."
Paracetamol,"Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.","Side effects of paracetamol are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally."
Pancuronium Bromide,"Pancuronium is a typical non-depolarising curare-mimetic muscle relaxant. It acts as a competitive acetylcholine antagonist on neuromuscular junctions, displacing acetylcholine (hence competitive) from its post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is, unlike suxamethonium, a non-depolarising agent, which means, that it causes no spontaneous depolarisations upon association with the nicotinic receptor in neuromuscular junction, thus producing no muscle fasciculations upon administration. Pancuronium has no hormonal activity. It exerts slight vagolytic activity (i.e. diminishing activity of the vagus nerve) and no ganglioplegic (i.e., blocking ganglions) activity.Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents inhibit neuromuscular transmission by competing with acetylcholine for the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate, thereby reducing the response of the end plate to acetylcholine. This type of neuromuscular block is usually antagonized by anticholinesterase agents.","Tachycardia, HTN, bradycardia, bronchospasm, hypotension, CV collapse, excessive salivation; pain or local skin reactions at inj site. Rarely, hypersensitivity reactions."
Pancreatin,"Pancreatin is a preparation of Pancreatin, an extract from mammalian pancreas containing enzymes with Amylase, Protease and Lipase activity. It is designed to disintegrate in the alkaline medium of the duodenum where it releases the active enzyme components of Pancreatin (Amylase, Protease and Lipase). Amylase hydrolyzes dietary starch to yield maltose, maltoriose and a-dextrin. Protease cleaves peptide bonds in the center of proteins and polypeptides and forms amino acids and oligopeptides. Lipase hydrolyzes dietary triglycerides forming two molecules of fatty acid and a molecule of beta-monoglyceride. It converts not less than 25 times its weight of starch into soluble carbohydrates and not less than 25 times its weight of casein into proteoses within 5 mins, (equivalent to 150 times in 30 mins).","The most frequent side effects are gastrointestinal including nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort. Buccal and perianal soreness may occur, particularly in infants. Hypersensitivity reactions manifested by sneezing, lacrimation or skin rashes have been reported."
Palonosetron,"Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT3 receptors that are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factorcs and is triggered by release of 5-HT3 in a cascade of neuronal event involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. Palonosetron works by blocking the actions of Serotonin, associated with nausea and vomiting, at 5-HTs receptor. It is likely that Palonosetron works in the small intestine but it may also work in the brain.Pharmacokinetics: Palonosetron exhibits linear dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over the doserange 1-90 pg/kg in healthy subjects and in patients with cancer. In cancer patients receiving single intravenous doses of Palonosetron in this dose range, the mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) ranges from 0.89 to 336 ng/ml and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUCo-co) ranges from 13.8 to 957 ng.h/ml. Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 6.9-7.9 L/kg, with approximately 62% bound to plasma proteins. Approximately 50% of Palonosetron is metabolized into two inactive metabolites that exhibit <1% of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist activity. Approximately 40% of the drug is metabolised via kidney, 50% by liver CYP2D6 (mainly), CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. About 50% of the drug goes under metabolism. After a single intravenous dose, approximately 40% is excreted as unchanged drug in the urine after 144 hours. Total body clearance of Palonosetron is 160±35 ml/h/kg, and renal clearance is 66.5±18.2 ml/h/kg in healthy subjects. Palonosetron exhibits a longer half-life (40 hours) and has a greater 5-HT3 receptor binding affinity.",The most common adverse reactions are headaches and constipation.
Paliperidone Palmitate,"Paliperidone palmitate is hydrolyzed to paliperidone. Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. The mechanism of action of paliperidone is unclear. However, the drug’s therapeutic effect in schizophrenia could be mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2 ) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT 2A ) receptor antagonism.In vitro, paliperidone acts as an antagonist at the central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT 2A) receptors with binding affinities (Ki values) of 1.6-2.8 nM for D 2 and 0.8-1.2 nM for 5HT 2A receptors. Paliperidone is also active as an antagonist at the α 1 and α 2 adrenergic receptors and H 1 histaminergic receptors, which may explain some of the other effects of the drug. Paliperidone has no affinity for cholinergic muscarinic or β1 and β2-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological activity of the (+)- and (-)- paliperidone enantiomers is qualitatively and quantitatively similar in vitro.","The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% and occurring at least twice as often as placebo) were injection site reactions, somnolence/sedation, dizziness, akathisia, and extrapyramidal disorder."
Paliperidone,"Paliperidone is a psychotropic agent belonging to the chemical class of benzisoxazole derivatives. Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of Risperidone. It is a centrally active dopamine Type 2 (D2) antagonist and with predominant serotonin Type 2 (5-HT2A) antagonist activity. It is also active as an antagonist at α1 and α2 adrenergic receptors and H1 histaminergic receptors, which may explain some of the other effects of the drug. It has no affinity for cholinergic muscarinic or β1-and β2-adrenergic receptors.","The most common adverse reactions of Paliperidone are tachycardia, akathisia, somnolence, tremor, dystonia, cogwheel rigidity, anxiety, weight increased, dyspepsia, constipation, nasopharyngitis etc."
Palbociclib,"Palbociclib is an inhibitor of Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6. cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 are downstream of signaling pathways that lead to cellular proliferation. Palbociclib reduced cellular proliferation of Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines by blocking progression of the cell from G1 into s phase of the cell cycle. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with the combination of Palbociclib and antiestrogens leads to decreased retinoblastoma (RB) protein phosphorylation resulting in reduced E2F expression and signaling, and increased growth arrest compared to treatment with each drug alone. Treatment of ER-positive breast cancer cell lines with the combination of Palbociclib and antiestrogens led to increased cell senescence compared to each drug alone, which was sustained for up to 6 days following Palbociclib removal and was greater if antiestrogen treatment was continued. In vivo studies using a patient-derived ER-positive breast cancer xenograft model demonstrated that the combination of Palbociclib and letrozole increased the inhibition of RB phosphorylation, downstream signaling, and tumor growth compared to each drug alone.","Common side effects of Palbociclib include: WBC decreased, Neutrophils decreased, Neutropenia, Platelets decreased, infections, AST increased, ALT increased, Leukopenia, Fatigue, Nausea, Hair loss, Inflammation of the mouth and lips, Diarrhea, Anemia, Rash, Weakness/lethargy, Vomiting, Thrombocytopenia, Dry skin, Fever."
Padimate O + Avobenzone + Oxybenzone + Titanium dioxide,"This lotion is a non-greasy, water resistant, protective sun block, which helps prevent sunburn in all types of skin. It provides a high degree of protection against the harmful effects of ultraviolet components of sunlight which are responsible for skin cancer, wrinkling, premature ageing and darkening of the skin due to overexposure.This provides a sun protection factor (SPF) of 6 against UVA rays and 28 against UVB rays. The SPF describes how much longer you can remain in the sun without being affected by these rays, compared with unprotected skin. This gives you 28 times more natural sunburn protection and maintains its degree of protection up to 60 minutes in water.","Signs of irritations (including erythema, burning or rash) may appear when applied to sensitive or broken skin."
Paclitaxel,"Paclitaxel is a novel anti-microtubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “bundles” of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis. Following intravenous administration of Paclitaxel, paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner. The initial rapid decline represents distribution to the peripheral compartment and elimination of the drug. The later phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of paclitaxel from the peripheral compartment.","Common: Low blood counts leading to increased risk for infection, anemia and/or bleeding, hair loss, arthralgias and myalgias, pain in the joints and muscles, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, vomiting (usually mild), diarrhea, Mouth sores, hypersensitivity reaction, fever, facial flushing, chills, shortness of breath, or hives after paclitaxel is given.Rare: swelling of the feet or ankles (edema), liver problems, low blood pressure, darkening of the skin where previous radiation treatment has been given."
Ozenoxacin,"Mechanism of Action: Ozenoxacin is a quinolone antimicrobial drug. The mechanism of action involves the inhibition of bacterial DNA replication enzymes, DNA gyrase A and topoisomerase IV. Ozenoxacin has been shown to be bactericidal against S. aureus and S. pyogenes organisms.Absorption: Four pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in 110 patients utilizing varying strengths of ozenoxacin cream, up to 2% (twice the concentration of the marketed formulation). Three of these studies assessed systemic absorption in healthy subjects and in subjects with impetigo. These studies were conducted with either single or repeated application of up to 1 g ozenoxacin cream to intact or abraded skin (up to 200 cm2 surface area). No systemic absorption was observed in 84 of 86 subjects, and negligible systemic absorption was observed at the level of detection (0.489 ng/mL) in 2 subjects.Distribution: Plasma protein binding of ozenoxacin was moderate (~80 to 85%) and did not appear to be dependent on concentration. Since negligible systemic absorption was observed in clinical studies, tissue distribution has not been investigated in humans.Metabolism: Ozenoxacin was not metabolized in the presence of fresh human skin discs and was minimally metabolized in human hepatocytes.Excretion: Studies have not been investigated in humans due to the negligible systemic absorption observed in clinical studies.","Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety profile of Ozenoxacin was assessed in two clinical trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) in 362 adult and pediatric patients two months of age and older with impetigo. The patients used at least one dose from a 5-day, twice a day regimen of Ozenoxacin. Control groups included 361 patients who used placebo and 152 patients who used retapamulin ointment. The median age of the patients enrolled in the clinical trials was 10 years; 3 % of patients were 2 months to less than 2 years of age, 55 % of patients were 2 to less than 12 years of age, 11 % of patients were 12 to less than 18 years of age, and 31 % of patients were 18 years of age or older. Adverse reactions (rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis) were reported in 1 adult patient treated with Ozenoxacin."
Oxytocin,"Uterine motility depends on the formation of the contractile protein actomyosin under the influence of the Ca2+ dependent phosphorylating enzyme myosin light-chain kinase. Oxytocin promotes contractions by increasing the intracellular Ca2+, which in turn activates myosin's light chain kinase. Oxytocin has specific receptors in the muscle lining of the uterus and the receptor concentration increases greatly during pregnancy, reaching a maximum in early labor at term.","Hypersensitivity to the drug may result in uterine hypertonicity, spasm, titanic contraction or rupture of the uterus. 
The possibility of increased blood loss and afbrinigenemia should be kept in mind when administering the drug.
Severe water intoxication with convulsions and coma has occurred. 
Oxytocin may occasionally cause nausea, vomiting, haemorrhage or cardiac arrhythmias, anaphylactic reaction."
Phenoxymethyl Penicillin [Penicillin V],"Phenoxymethyl penicillin or penicillin V is acid-stable and is absorbed from the upper part of the small intestine. Of different forms of Phenoxymethyl penicillin, the potassium salt of Phenoxymethyl penicillin is best absorbed. This may be given with meals but maximum absorption is achieved when drug is administered orally at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the meal. Phenoxymethyl penicillin offers a very convenient means of treating Grampositive infections. Phenoxymethyl penicillin has the distinct advantage over penicillin G in resistance to inactivation by gastric acid.","Occasionally, hypersensitivity reactions involving the skin (e.g. urticaria, morbilliform or scarlatiniform rashes, pruritus), eosinophilia or more serious allergic reactions, e.g. drug fever, vasculitis, serum sickness or interstitial nephritis, may develop. Anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions accompanied by, e.g- angioneurotic oedema, oedema of the larynx, bronchial spasm and shock may occur.In the event of signs pointing to anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, the treatment must be terminated immediately. In occasional instances, there may be skin rashes or inflammation of mucous membranes, especially in the region of the mouth (stomatitis); dryness of the mouth and disorders of taste may rarely occur.The occurrence of severe bullous skin reactions- usually involving the mucosae- has been reported in isolated cases (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Lyell's syndrome). Gastrointestinal disturbances with, e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loose stools, or diarrhoea may develop. Diarrhoea may sometimes be a symptom of enterocolitis which may, in some cases, be haemorrhagic. A particular form of enterocolitis that can occur with antibiotics is pseudomembranous colitis (in most cases due to Clostridium diffcile). This must be considered in patients in whom severe, persistent diarrhoea occurs during treatment or in the initial weeks thereafter. Even if pseudomembranous colitis is only suspected, administration of Phenoxymethyl penicillin must be halted immediately. This type of colitis requires immediate and appropriate treatment by a physician. Drugs that inhibit intestinal peristalsis must not be taken in such cases. In isolated cases, particularly after high doses and prolonged administration, changes in blood picture such as reduction in the number of white blood cells (e.g.,leucopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis), erythrocytes (e.g., due to haemolytic anaemia), thrombocytes, or pancytopenia and myelosuppression may occur. During treatment for spirochaetal infections, Herxheimer's reaction characterized by the occurrence or worsening of general symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, and joint pains may develop. In isolated cases, drug-induced aseptic meningitis may occur. In extremely rare cases, transient discolouration of the teeth may be seen during treatment with Phenoxymethyl penicillin. Administration of antibiotics, especially if prolonged, may lead to the proliferation of resistant micro organisms.Beta-lactams predispose the patient to encephalopathy risk (which may include convulsions, confusion, impairment of consciousness, movement disorders), particularly in case of overdose or renal impairment."
Phenobarbital,"Phenobarbital, the longest-acting barbiturate, is used for its anticonvulsant and sedative-hypnotic properties in the management of all seizure disorders except absence (petit mal). Phenobarbital acts on GABAA receptors, increasing synaptic inhibition. This has the effect of elevating seizure threshold and reducing the spread of seizure activity from a seizure focus. Phenobarbital may also inhibit calcium channels, resulting in a decrease in excitatory transmitter release. The sedative-hypnotic effects of phenobarbital are likely the result of its effect on the polysynaptic midbrain reticular formation, which controls CNS arousal.","The most common adverse reaction is somnolence. Other less frequent adverse reactions are agitation, confusion, hyperkinesia, ataxia, CNS depression, nightmares, nervousness, psychiatric disturbance, hallucinations, insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, thinking abnormality, apnea, bradycardia, hypotension, nausea, vomiting and constipation."
Pheniramine Maleate,"Pheniramine competes with histamine for the histamine H1 receptor, acting as an inverse agonist once bound. The reduction in H1 receptor activity is responsible for reduced itching as well as reduced vasodilation and capillary leakage leading to less redness and edema. This can be seen in the suppression of the histamine-induced wheal (swelling) and flare (vasodilation) response. Inverse agonism of the H1 receptor in the CNS is also responsible for the sedation produced by first-generation antihistamines like pheniramine. The binding of pheniramine to H4 receptors, and subsequent inverse agonism, may also contribute to reduced itching by antagonizing inflammation.","The most common adverse reaction is sedation, which often disappears after a few days if tolerance is acquired. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.

Central Nervous System: Lassitude, dizziness, tinnitus, inability to concentrate, incoordination, irritability, insomnia and tremors. Agitation and convulsions, especially in children and restlessness, disorientation and hallucinations in adults, are common symptoms following overdose.
Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, colic, epigastric pain, anorexia, dryness of mouth and constipation.
Genitourinary: Urinary retention.
Cardiovascular: Palpitations, headache.
Ocular: Blurred vision, increased intraocular pressure.
Musculoskeletal: Muscular weakness.
Haematological: Rare cases of blood dyscrasias including agranulocytosis and haemolytic anaemia have been reported."
Pethidine Hydrochloride,"Pethidine is a phenylpiperidine derivative opioid analgesic. It acts mainly as mu-receptor agonist. Like most, opioid analgesics, it mimics endogenous opioids by activating opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system. It reduces the release of neurotransmitter substances and also reduces the activity of postsynaptic neurons in the spinal cord thus preventing transmission of pain impulse.","Central Nervous System:  Lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, sweating, bizarre feelings, disorientation, hallucinations, psychosis. Some of these effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and those not experiencing severe pain, and may be relieved by reducing the dose slightly and lying down.Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting, constipation."
Pertuzumab,"Pertuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to bind to the HER2 receptor and inhibit the ability of HER2 to interact with other HER family members (HER1, HER2, HER3, and HER4) on the surface of cancer cells. The HER signaling pathway plays a role in the formation and growth of numerous cancers, and previous clinical trials of pertuzumab in a single agent setting had suggested clinical activity-including stable disease-in heavily pretreated patients with advanced ovarian and breast cancers.","Metastatic Breast Cancer:

Permethrin + Crotamiton,Permethrin is a pyrethroid pediculocide and scabicide. It causes paralysis and death of the pest by inhibiting sodium ion influx through nerve cell membrane channels delaying repolarisation.Crotamiton has scabicidal and antipruritic action against Sarcoptes scabei. It is an effective pediculocide as well.,"Occasional reports of burning or stinging sensation which passes quickly. This is usually mild and occurs more frequently in patients with severe scabies. Transient signs and symptoms of skin irritation including rash or itching, erythema, edema and eczema. These are generally considered to be part of the natural history of scabies."
Permethrin,"Permethrin cream contains Permethrin, a pyrethroid, which is a topical scabicidal agent for the treatment of infestation with Sarcoptes Scabiei (scabies). It acts on the nerve cell membrane to disrupt the sodium channel current by which the polarization of the membrane is regulated. Delayed repolarization & paralysis of the pests are the consequences of this disturbance.Pharmacokinetics: The only approved route of administration is the topical route and there are few human data available on systemic exposure or kinetics following permethrin application to the skin. Some presystemic metabolism occurs in skin. Less than 0.5% of applied permethrin is absorbed during the first 48 hours. Absorbed permethrin is rapidly metabolized by ester hydrolysis, most likely in the liver and the products are excreted primarily in the urine.","In Scabies patients, skin discomfort, usually described as burning, stinging or tingling occurs in a few individuals soon after the cream is applied. Others transient signs and symptoms of irritation including enythema, edema, eczema, rash and puritis."
Peritoneal Dialysis solutions,"Calcium chloride is used to prevent or treat negative calcium balance. It also regulates action potential excitation threshold to facilitate nerve and muscle performance.Potassium chloride is a major cation of the intracellular fluid. It plays an active role in the conduction of nerve impulses in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle; contraction of cardiac skeletal and smooth muscles; maintenance of normal renal function, acid-base balance, carbohydrate metabolism and gastric secretion.Sodium chloride is the major extracellular cation. It is important in electrolyte and fluid balance, osmotic pressure control and water distribution as it restores sodium ions. It is used as a source of electrolytes and water for hydration, treatment of metabolic acidosis, priming solution in haemodialysis and treatment of hyperosmolar diabetes. It is also used as diluents for infusion of compatible drug additives.Sodium lactate is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution that is used for fluid and electrolyte replenishment. It has metabolic alkalinising ability and is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient.Dextrose is a monosaccharide that is used as a source of calories and water for hydration. It helps to reduce loss of body protein and nitrogen. It also promotes glycogen deposition in the liver. When used with insulin, it stimulates the uptake of potassium by cells, especially in muscle tissue, thus lowering serum potassium levels.","During dialysis amino acids and water soluble vitamins may be lost. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance, hypovolemia, hypotension or muscle cramping may occur."
Perindopril Arginine + Amlodipine,"Perindopril, a pro-drug, is hydrolyzed to perindoprilat, which inhibits ACE in humans and in animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the inactive decapeptide, angiotensin I, to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor, which stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, and provides negative feedback on renin secretion. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, leading to decreased vasoconstriction, increased plasma renin activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter results in diuresis and natriuresis and may be associated with an increase in serum potassium Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses.","The most commonly reported adverse reactions with perindopril and amlodipine given separately are: oedema, somnolence, dizziness, headache (especially at the beginning of the treatment), dysgeusia, paraesthesia, visual impairment (including diplopia), tinnitus, vertigo, palpitations, flushing, hypotension (and effects related to hypotension), dyspnoea, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, change of bowel habit, diarrhoea, constipation, pruritus, rash, exanthema, joint swelling (ankle swelling), muscle spasms, fatigue, asthenia."
Perindopril Arginine,"Perindopril is an ACE inhibitor. It works by blocking the action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). ACE produces angiotensin II, as part of the body's natural control of blood pressure. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to constrict and narrow, which increases the pressure within the blood vessels. Perindopril blocks the action of ACE, it reduces the production of angiotensin II, thus allows the blood vessels to relax and widen. The overall effect of this is a drop in blood pressure.","Rare and mild: usually at the start of treatment cough, fatigue, asthenia, headache, disturbances of mood and/or sleep have been reported.Less often: Taste impairment, epigastric discomfort, nausea, abdominal pain and rash. Reversible increase in blood urea and creatinine may be observed. Proteinuria has occurred in some patients.Rarely: Angioneurotic edema and decrease in hemoglobin, red cells and platelets have been reported."
Perampanel,Perampanel is a non-competitive antagonist of the ionotropic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor on post-synaptic neurons. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is implicated in a number of neurological disorders caused by neuronal over excitation. The precise mechanism by which Perampanel exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans is unknown.,"Perampanel may cause Serious Psychiatric and Behavioral Reactions, Suicidal Behavior and Ideation, Dizziness, Somnolence, Fatigue, Irritability, Falls, Nausea, Ataxia, Balance Disorder etc."
Pentoxifylline,"Pentoxifylline and its metabolites improve the flow properties of blood by decreasing its viscosity. In patients with chronic peripheral arterial disease, this increases blood flow to the affected microcirculation and enhances tissue oxygenation. The precise mode of action of pentoxifylline and the sequence of events leading to clinical improvement are still to be defined. Pentoxifylline administration has been shown to produce dose-related hemorrheologic effects, lowering blood viscosity, and improving erythrocyte flexibility. Leukocyte properties of hemorrheologic importance have been modified in animal and in vitro human studies. Pentoxifylline has been shown to increase leukocyte deformability and to inhibit neutrophil adhesion and activation. Tissue oxygen levels have been shown to be significantly increased by therapeutic doses of pentoxifylline in patients with peripheral arterial disease.","These adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials or post-marketing-

Pembrolizumab,"Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.","Most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients) were:Pembrolizumab as a single agent: fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, pruritus, diarrhea, nausea, rash, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, constipation, pain, and abdominal pain.Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy: fatigue/asthenia, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, vomiting, cough, dyspnea, pyrexia, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, mucosal inflammation, and stomatitis.Pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib: diarrhea, fatigue/asthenia, hypertension, hepatotoxicity, hypothyroidism, decreased appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, nausea, stomatitis/mucosal inflammation, dysphonia, rash, cough, and constipation.Pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib: fatigue, hypertension, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, decreased appetite, hypothyroidism, nausea, stomatitis, vomiting, decreased weight, abdominal pain, headache, constipation, urinary tract infection, dysphonia, hemorrhagic events, hypomagnesemia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, dyspnea, cough, and rash."
Pegylated Erythropoietin,"Pegylated erythropoietin is an erythropoietin receptor activator with greater activity in vivo as well as increased half-life, in contrast to erythropoietin. It differs from erythropoietin through the integration of an amide bond between the N-terminal amino group or the ε-amino group of any lysine present in erythropoietin, predominantly Lys52 and Lys45 and Pegylated Erythropoietin (PEG).","Increased Mortality, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Thromboembolism

Pegfilgrastim [Pegylated Filgrastim],"Pegfilgrastim, a Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) is a pegylated glycoprotein that regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils from bone marrow. Pegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of recombinant methionyl human G-CSF (Filgrastim) and monomethoxy polyethylene glycol. Filgrastim is a water soluble 175 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of approximately 19 kilodaltons (kD) and a 20 kD monomethoxy polyethylene glycol molecule is covalently bound to the N-terminal methionyl residue of filgrastim. The average molecular weight of pegfilgrastim is approximately 39 kD.","Splenic Rupture: Splenic rupture, including fatal cases, can occur following the administration of Pegfilgrastim. Evaluate for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture in patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain after receiving Pegfilgrastim.Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) can occur in patients receiving Pegfilgrastim. Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress after receiving Pegfilgrastim for ARDS. Discontinue Pegfilgrastim in patients with ARDS.Serious Allergic Reactions: Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis can occur in patients receiving Pegfilgrastim.

Podophyllotoxin,Podophyllotoxin has an antimitotic action and is used mainly as a topical treatment for anogenital warts.,"Irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes; GI disturbances; thrombocytopenia, leucopenia; renal failure; hepatotoxicity; CNS effects; EEG changes; peripheral and autonomic neuropathies; local reactions"
Pizotifen,"Pizotifen works by inhibiting the peripheral actions of serotonin and histamine in increasing the membrane permeability of cranial vessels and transudation of plasmakinin, while altering pain thresholds in migraines. By blocking 5-HT receptors, pizotifen attenuates the signalling of serotonin in causing cranial vasoconstriction, as well as serotonin-enhanced platelet function and aggregation. There is evidence that it also inhibits the peripheral actions of bradykinin. Pizotifen may inhibit serotonin reuptake by blood platelets, which affects the tonicity and decreases passive distension of extracranial arteries. The effects of pizotifen leading to appetite stimulation may be due to the drug acting at the metabolic level rather than a direct stimulation of the appetite centre.","The most common side effects are appetite stimulating effect, increase in body weight and drowsiness."
Pivmecillinam,"Pivmecillinam belongs to a new class of penicillin-the amdinopenicillin. Pivmecillinam is a prodrug formulation of mecillinam which allows the drug to be administered by mouth. The prodrug form lacks antibacterial activity, but the active drug is liberated by enzymatic hydrolysis during absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.Pivmecillinam is bactericidal. It acts by interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis, but the site of action differs from that of other penicilins. Pivmecillinam is very active against Enterobacteriaceae. It is active against E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Enterobacter, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia. Pivmecillinam has poor activity against Gram- positive organisms. It has poor activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and has practically no activity against Enterococcus faecalis.","Pivmecillinam is generally well tolerated, even by patients with reduced kidney function. Upper gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea or indigestion may occur when a dose has been given on an empty stomach. Skin rashes have been reported in some cases, but the characteristic ampicillin-rash has never been observed, nor has there been any evidence of hepato-, nephro-, or ototoxicity. The occurrence of anaphylaxis, though not yet reported, cannot be entirely excluded."
Pitavastatin Calcium,Pitavastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL.,"Rhabdomyolysis, myopathy and Liver enzyme abnormalities."
Pirfenidone,"Pirfenidone is an orally active, small molecule that shows a wide range of biologic activity. In vitro evidence has shown that pirfenidone inhibits collagen synthesis, down-regulates profibrotic cytokines and decreases fibroblast proliferation. Pirfenidone leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, pirfenidone reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis.","The safety of Pirfenidone has been evaluated in clinical studies including 1345 healthy volunteers and patients. The most commonly reported (10%) adverse reactions during clinical study experience with Pirfenidone at a dose of 2403 mg/day compared to placebo, respectively, were nausea (32.8% versus 13.3%), rash (28.7% versus 8.6%), fatigue (22.3% versus 13.3%), diarrhoea (21.7% versus 13.5%), dyspepsia (16.8% versus 5.5%), and photosensitivity reaction (12.2% versus 1.7%). Serious adverse reactions were recorded at similar frequencies among patients treated with 2403 mg/day of Pirfenidone and placebo in clinical studies. The adverse reactions reported at a frequency of 2% in 345 patients receiving Pirfenidone at the recommended dose of 2403 mg/day in two pivotal Phase 3 studies. Adverse reactions from post-marketing experience are also listed. Adverse reactions are listed by System Organ Class (SOC) and within each frequency grouping the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness."
Piracetam,"Piracetam's mechanism of action is not fully understood. The drug influences neuronal and vascular functions and influences cognitive function without acting as a sedative or stimulant. Piracetam is a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptor. It is hypothesized to act on ion channels or ion carriers, thus leading to increased neuron excitability. GABA brain metabolism and GABA receptors are not affected by piracetamIt has been found to increase blood flow and oxygen consumption in parts of the brain, but this may be a side effect of increased brain activity rather than a primary effect or mechanism of action for the drug.Piracetam improves the function of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine via muscarinic cholinergic (ACh) receptors, which are implicated in memory processes. Furthermore, piracetam may have an effect on NMDA glutamate receptors, which are involved with learning and memory processes. Piracetam is thought to increase cell membrane permeability. Piracetam may exert its global effect on brain neurotransmission via modulation of ion channels (i.e., Na+, K+). It has been found to increase oxygen consumption in the brain, apparently in connection to ATP metabolism, and increases the activity of adenylate kinase in rat brains. Piracetam, while in the brain, appears to increase the synthesis of cytochrome b5, which is a part of the electron transport mechanism in mitochondria. But in the brain, it also increases the permeability of the mitochondria of some intermediaries of the Krebs cycle.","The side effects reported include nervousness, agitation, irritability, anxiety and sleep disturbances. The incidence of these during clinical trials was (≤ 5%) and they were more often noted in the older patients taking > 2.4 gm daily. In the majority of cases, a dose reduction sufficed to make these symptoms disappear. Some patients may complain of fatigue or drowsiness, gastrointestinal problems, e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and stomachache have also been reported but their incidence during clinical trials was ≤ 2%. Other symptoms e.g. vertigo, headache, trembling and sexual stimulation have occasionally been reported."
Piperacillin + Tazobactam,"Piperacillin, a broad spectrum, semi-synthetic penicillin active against many gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, exerts bactericidal activity by inhibition of both septum and cell wall synthesis. Tazobactam is a potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including the plasmid and chromosomally mediated enzymes that commonly cause resistance to penicillins. Tazobactam enhances and extends the antibiotic spectrum of Piperacillin to include many beta-lactamase-producing bacteria normally resistant to it. Thus, this infusion combines the properties of a broad-spectrum antibiotic and a beta-lactamase inhibitor.","Adverse events primarily involving the skin, including rash, pruritus and Purpura; the gastrointestinal system including diarrhea, Constipation, nausea, vomiting, Dyspepsia and Abdominal Pain; General disorders and administration site conditions including Fever, Injection site reaction (≤1%) and Rigors.

Pipecuronium Bromide,"Pipecuronium is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. Neuromuscular blocking agents produce skeletal muscle paralysis by blocking neural transmission at the myoneural junction. The paralysis is selective initially and usually appears in the following muscles consecutively: levator muscles of eyelids, muscles of mastication, limb muscles, abdominal muscles, muscles of the glottis, and finally, the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. Neuromuscular blocking agents have no clinically significant effect on consciousness or the pain threshold.Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents inhibit neuromuscular transmission by competing with acetylcholine for the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate, thereby reducing the response of the end plate to acetylcholine. This type of neuromuscular block is usually antagonized by anticholinesterase agents.","Transient hypotension, bradycardia, reduced cardiac output."
Pioglitazone + Metformin Hydrochloride,"Pioglitazone depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulindependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is a potent and highly selective agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARg). Activation of PPARg nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.Metformin hydrochloride improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia.","Generally this combined preparation is well tolerated. However, the most common side effects are upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, peripheral edema and headache, respectively. These are mild in severity."
Pioglitazone + Glimepiride,"Pioglitazone & Glimepiride combines two antihyperglycemic agents with different mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: Pioglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione class, and Glimepiride, a member of the sulfonylurea class.Pioglitazone is an insulin-sensitizing agent that acts primarily by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization. It depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is a potent and highly selective agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.The primary mechanism of action of Glimepiride in lowering blood glucose appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells. In addition, extrapancreatic effects may also play a role in the activity of sulfonylureas such as Glimepiride. This is supported by both preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating that Glimepiride administration can lead to increased sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin.","Pioglitazone: The most common adverse experiences with Pioglitazone monotherapy (≥5%) were upper respiratory tract infection, injury, and headache. Overall, the types of adverse experiences reported when Pioglitazone was used in combination with a sulfonylurea were similar to those during monotherapy with Pioglitazone. Other adverse events reported in at least 5% of patients in controlled clinical studies between placebo and Pioglitazone monotherapy included myalgia (2.7% and 5.4%), tooth disorder (2.3% and 5.3%), diabetes mellitus aggravated (8.1% and 5.1%) and pharyngitis (0.8% and 5.1%), respectively. In monotherapy studies, edema was reported for 4.8% (with doses from 7.5 mg to 45 mg) of patients treated with Pioglitazone versus 1.2% of placebo treated patients.Glimepiride: Hypoglycemia: The incidence of hypoglycemia with Glimepiride is documented. In patients treated with Glimepiride, adverse events, other than hypoglycemia, considered to be possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in more than 1% of patients included dizziness (1.7%), asthenia (1.6%), headache (1.5%), and nausea (1.1%). Dermatologic Reactions: Allergic skin reactions, e.g., pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions, occur in less than 1% of treated patients. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of Glimepiride."
Pioglitazone,"Pioglitazone is a preparation of Pioglitazone which is a member of the newest class of oral antidiabetic agent called thiazolidinediones. It depends on the presence of Insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases Insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver, resulting in increased Insulin dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. It also improves abnormality in lipid metabolism by activating peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ).","The overall incidence and types of adverse events reported in placebo controlled clinical trials of Pioglitazone monotherapy at doses of 7.5 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg or 45 mg once daily are upper respiratory tract infection (13.2%), headache (9.1%), sinusitis (6.3%), myalgia (5.4%), tooth disorder (5.3%), and pharyngitis (5.1%)."
Pimecrolimus,"Pimecrolimus is a macrolactam and is a derivative of ascomycin. It is an immunosuppressant which inhibits the activation of T-cells and prevents the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells. It is used for the short term or intermittent long term treatment for mild to moderate atopic eczema.The mechanism of action of pimecrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not known. While the following have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not known. It has been demonstrated that pimecrolimus binds with high affinity to macrophilin-12 (FKBP-12) and inhibits the calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. As a consequence, it inhibits T cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines. In particular, pimecrolimus inhibits at nanomolar concentrations Interleukin-2 and interferon gamma (Th1-type) and Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10 (Th2-type) cytokine synthesis in human T-cells. In addition, pimecrolimus prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells in vitro after stimulation by antigen/IgE.","Common side effects include headache, common cold or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough flu (influenza), fever, viral infection. Some people may get viral skin infections (like cold sores, chicken pox, shingles, or warts) or swollen lymph nodes (glands)."
Pimavanserin,"The mechanism of action of pimavanserin in the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis is unknown. However, the effect of pimavanserin could be mediated through a combination of inverse agonist and antagonist activity at serotonin 5-HT 2A receptors and to a lesser extent at serotonin 5-HT2C receptors.","Nausea, Constipation, Peripheral edema, Gait disturbance, Hallucination, Confusional state."
Pilocarpine Hydrochloride (Oral),"Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist exerting a broad spectrum of pharmacologic effects with predominant muscarinic action. Pilocarpine, in appropriate dosage, can increase secretion by the exocrine glands such as sweat, salivary, lacrimal, gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal glands and the mucous cells of the respiratory tract. The tone and motility of urinary tract, gallbladder and biliary duct, smooth muscle may be enhanced.","Headache, visual disturbance, lacrimation, sweating, respiratory distress, gastrointestinal spasm, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, atrioventricular block, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, shock, mental confusion, cardiac arrhythmia, and tremors etc may occur. Most of the adverse experiences observed during pilocarpine treatment were consequences of exaggerated parasympathetic stimulation. These adverse experiences were dose-dependent and usually mild and self-limited."
Pilocarpine Hydrochloride (Ophthalmic),"Pilocarpine Hydrochloride directly stimulates cholinergic receptors. It produces contraction of the iris sphincter muscle, resulting in pupillary constriction (miosis); constriction of the ciliary muscle, resulting in increased accommodation; and reduction in intraocular pressure associated with an increase in the outflow and a decrease in the inflow of aqueous humor. In chronic open angle glaucoma, the exact mechanism by which miotics lower intraocular pressure is not exactly known; however, contraction of the ciliary muscle apparently opens the intertrabecular spaces and facilitates aqueous humor outflow. There is also a decrease in the rate of inflow of aqueous humor. In angle-closure glaucoma, constriction of the pupil apparently pulls the iris away from the trabeculum, thereby relieving blockage of the trabecular meshwork.","Common: Temporary blurred vision, burning, stinging, redness, watering of the eyes, decrease in night vision, eye irritation, headache. Rare: Eye pain, increased sweating, muscle tremors, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, watering of the mouth, troubled breathing or wheezing."
Phytomenadione (Oral),"Vitamin K1 is an essential co-factor in the hepatic synthesis of prothrombin (factor II) and other blood clotting factors (factor VII, IX, X). Vitamin K1 does not readily cross the placenta barrier from mother to child and is poorly excreted in breast milk. Low levels at birth may lead to the development of the hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN). Administration of Phytomenadione promotes the synthesis of essential coagulation factors in the liver and minimizes the risk of Vitamin K1 Deficiency Bleeding (VKDB). After oral administration of Phytomenadione, it is absorbed from small intestine and taken up by the liver, even in the absence of biliary and pancreatic secretions. Its plasma half-life is 2-3 hours.",No adverse effects have been associated with oral administration.
Phytomenadione (Injection),"Phytomenadione is a procoagulant factor. As a component of a hepatic carboxylase system, Phytomenadione is involved in the post translational carboxylation of clotting factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX and X and the clotting inhibitors protein C and protein S. Phytomenadione is ineffective in hereditary hypoprothrombinemia or hypoprothrombinemia induced by severe hepatic failure. Lack of Phytomenadione leads to an increased tendency to haemorrhagic disease in the newborn. Phytomenadione administration, which promotes synthesis of the above-mentioned coagulation factors by the liver, can reverse an abnormal coagulation status and bleeding due to Phytomenadione deficiency.",There are isolated unconfirmed reports on the possible occurrence of anaphylactoid reactions and venous irritation or phlebitis after parenteral use of Phytomenadione injections.
Phospholipids,"Endogenous pulmonary surfactant lowers surface tension on alveolar surfaces during respiration and stabilizes the alveoli against collapse at resting transpulmonary pressures. Deficiency of pulmonary surfactant causes Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in premature infants. Phospholipid replenishes surfactant and restores surface activity to the lungs of these infants.In vitro, Phospholipid reproducibly lowers minimum surface tension to less than 8 dynes/cm on the pulsating bubble surfactometer and Wilhelmy Surface Balance.In vivo, single Phospholipid doses improve lung pressure-volume measurements,  lung compliance, and oxygenation in premature rabbit and sheep.","Respiratory: lung consolidation, blood from the endotracheal tube, deterioration after weaning, respiratory decompensation, subglottic stenosis, paralyzed diaphragm, respiratory failure.

Solutions for inj may cause local irritation or phlebitis. Prolonged use may produce subtle effects on mental function and cognition, especially in children."
Prednisolone,"Prednisolone is a synthetic adrenocortical drug with predominantly glucocorticoid properties. Prednisolone directly inhibits the action of the Phospholipase A2 enzyme which is responsible for the production of different inflammatory mediators like Leukotrienes, SRS-A, Prostaglandins etc. Prednisolone is rapidly and well absorbed from the Gl tract following oral administration. Prednisolone is 70- 90% protein-bound in the plasma and it is eliminated from the plasma with a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. It is metabolized mainly in the liver and excreted in the urine.","Common side effects include increased appetite, indigestion, nervousness or restlessness. Less frequent or rare side effects are darkening or lightening of skin color, dizziness or lightheadedness, flushing of face or cheeks, hiccups, increased sweating, the sensation of spinning."
Precipitated Sulpher + Salicylic Acid,"Salicylic acid is a potent keratolytic with mild antiseptic action when applied topically. Sulfur topical is a scabicide and keratolytic agent.The mechanism of action when these two ingredients are combined, may be a synergistic keratolytic effect. The mechanism of action of salicylic acid in the treatment of acne may also include anti-inflammatory activity.","Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur: Skin irritation not present before use of salicylic acid and sulfurSome side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:

Redness and peeling of skin (may occur after a few days)
unusual dryness of skin"
Prazosin Hydrochloride,"Prazosin causes a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance through selective inhibition of postsynaptic alpha-1-adrenoreceptors in vascular smooth muscle. In hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions; this effect is more pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure. Rebound elevation of blood pressure does not occur following abrupt cessation of Prazosin therapy.The therapeutic efficacy of Prazosin in patients with congestive heart failure is ascribed to a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, reduction in cardiac impedance and an augmentation of cardiac output. The use of Prazosin in congestive heart failure does not provoke a reflex tachycardia and blood pressure reduction is minimal in normotensive patients. Prazosin reduce the severity of the signs, symptoms, frequency and duration of attacks, in patients with Raynaud's disease. In low dosage, antagonism of alpha-1-receptors on prostatic and urethral smooth muscle has been shown to improve the urinary pressure profile in men and to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Clinical studies have shown that Prazosin therapy is not associated with adverse changes in the serum lipid profile.","The most common side effects of Prazosin are allergic reaction, depression, nervousness, insomnia, Hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, faintness, syncope, paraesthesia, worsening of pre-existing narcolepsy, blurred vision, eye pain, reddened sclera, vertigo, tinnitus, palpitations etc."

Pramoxine Hydrochloride + Calamine,"Pramoxine Hydrochloride blocks Na+ ion channel in neuronal cell membrane and prevents pain transmission, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Calamine causing a cooling sensation and provides anti-itching action.","Local skin reaction, e.g. anaphylactoid, burning, stinging, contact dermatitis, tenderness, urticaria, skin peeling and skin lesions"
Pramipexole,"The exact mechanism of action of pramipexole as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown at this time. It is thought, however, that the ability of pramipexole to cause stimulation of the dopamine receptors in the striatum of the brain, a region that receives a vast array of neurological input and is responsible for a wide variety of functions, may be involved. Studies performed in animals show that pramipexole influences striatal neuronal transmission rates following activation of dopamine receptors. Pramipexole is considered a non-ergot dopamine agonist that shows specificity and strong activity at the D2 subfamily of dopamine receptors in vitro, binding selectively and dopamine D2 receptors and showing a preference for the dopamine D3 receptor subtype rather than other subtypes. The clinical significance of this binding specificity is unknown.","The common side effects are dizziness, dyskinesia, nausea, hypotension, abnormal dreams, confusion, constipation, delusion, hallucinations, headache, hyperkinesia, increased eating (binge eating, hyperphagia), insomnia, libido disorders, nausea, peripheral oedema, paranoia, pathological gambling, hypersexuality and other abnormal behaviour, somnolence, weight increase, sudden onset of sleep, pruritus and rash and other hypersensitivity."
Pralidoxime Chloride,"Pralidoxime reactivates cholinesterase outside the CNS that had been inactivated by phosphorylation due to exposure to certain organophosphates by displacing the enzyme from its receptor sites. It removes the phosphoryl group from the active site of the inactivated enzyme by nucleophilic attack, regenerating active cholinesterase and forming an oxime complex. It also detoxifies certain organophosphates by direct chemical reaction.","Drowsiness, dizziness, visual disturbances, nausea, HTN, tachycardia, headache, hyperventilation, muscle weakness, impaired renal function, elevated liver enzymes, transient increase in creatine phosphokinase, transient neuromuscular blockade; mild to moderate pain at inj site."
Povidone Iodine,"Povidone Iodine is a complex of iodine and an organic polymer, povidone. This polymerization makes Povidone Iodine superior to ordinary elemental iodine. It prolongs the germicidal activity of iodine by liberating elemental iodine slowly. Consequently it has a lower toxicity than elemental iodine. It gives rapid microbicidal activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, protozoa, viruses and fungi/yeasts. It is also sporicidal. It is the only microbicide with this broad spectrum of activity. It is non-staining, exerts prolong germicidal action and is also active in the presence of soap, blood, serum, pus, mucosal secretions and water.","Povidone Iodine may cause hypersensitivity reactions and irritation of the skin and mucous membranes. The application of povidone Iodine to severe burns or to large areas otherwise denuded of skin may produce systemic adverse effects such as metabolic acidosis, hypernatraemia, and impairment of renal function. It may interfere with thyroid function tests."
Potassium Citrate + Citric Acid,"Potassium Citrate and Citric Acid oral solution is a stable and pleasant-tasting oral systemic alkalizer. Potassium Citrate is absorbed and metabolized to Potassium Bicarbonate, thus acting as a systemic alkalizer. This product alkalinizes the urine without producing a systemic alkalosis in recommended doses. It is highly palatable, pleasant tasting and tolerable, even when administered for long periods. Potassium Citrate does not neutralize the gastric juice or disturb digestion.","This solution is generally well tolerated without any unpleasant side effect when given in recommended doses to patients with normal renal function and urinary output. However, as with any alkalinizing agent, caution must be used in certain patients with abnormal renal mechanisms to avoid development of hyperkalemia or alkalosis. Potassium intoxication causes listlessness, weakness, mental confusion, tingling of extremities and other symptoms associated with a high concentration of Potassium in the serum."
Potassium Citrate,"When Potassium Citrate is given orally, the metabolism of absorbed citrate produces an alkaline load. The induced alkaline load in turn increases urinary pH and raises urinary citrate by augmenting citrate clearance without measurably altering ultrafilterable serum citrate. Thus, Potassium Citrate therapy appears to increase urinary citrate principally by modifying the renal handling of citrate, rather than by increasing the filtered load of citrate. The increased filtered load of citrate may play some role, however, as in small comparisons of oral citrate and oral bicarbonate, citrate had a greater effect on urinary citrate.In addition to raising urinary pH and citrate, Potassium Citrate increases urinary potassium by approximately the amount contained in the medication. In some patients, Potassium Citrate causes a transient reduction in urinary calcium.The changes induced by Potassium Citrate produce urine that is less conducive to the crystallization of stoneforming salts (calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate and uric acid). Increased citrate in the urine, by complexing with calcium, decreases calcium ion activity and thus the saturation of calcium oxalate. Citrate also inhibits the spontaneous nucleation of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate (brushite).The increase in urinary pH also decreases calcium ion activity by increasing calcium complexation to dissociated anions. The rise in urinary pH also increases the ionization of uric acid to the more soluble urate ion.Potassium Citrate therapy does not alter the urinary saturation of calcium phosphate, since the effect of increased citrate complexation of calcium is opposed by the rise in pH-dependent dissociation of phosphate. Calcium phosphate stones are more stable in alkaline urine.In the setting of normal renal function, the rise in urinary citrate following a single dose begins by the first hour and lasts for 12 hours. With multiple doses the rise in citrate excretion reaches its peak by the third day and averts the normally wide circadian fluctuation in urinary citrate, thus maintaining urinary citrate at a higher, more constant level throughout the day. When the treatment is withdrawn, urinary citrate begins to decline toward the pre-treatment level on the first day.The rise in citrate excretion is directly dependent on the Potassium Citrate dosage. Following long-term treatment, Potassium Citrate at a dosage of 60 mEq/day raises urinary citrate by approximately 400 mg/day and increases urinary pH by approximately 0.7 units.In patients with severe renal tubular acidosis or chronic diarrheal syndrome where urinary citrate may be very low (<100 mg/day), Potassium Citrate may be relatively ineffective in raising urinary citrate. A higher dose of Potassium Citrate may therefore be required to produce a satisfactory citraturic response. In patients with renal tubular acidosis in whom urinary pH may be high, Potassium Citrate produces a relatively small rise in urinary pH.","Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain may occur. Taking it after meals will help prevent these side effects. An empty tablet shell may appear in your stool. This is harmless because your body has already absorbed the medication.This drug may cause serious stomach or intestinal problems (e.g., bleeding, blockage, puncture). This medication may cause high potassium levels in the blood (hyperkalemia). A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare."
Potassium Chloride,"Potassium Chloride is used for the treatment of hypokalaemia and of potassium deficiency states. Potassium ion is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues. It participates in a number of essential physiological processes, including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle and the maintenance of normal renal function.","Excessive administration of potassium leads to development of hyperkalaemia, the symptoms of which include paraesthesia of the extremitis, muscle weakness, paralysis, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, heart block and cardiac arrest. Pain or phlebitis may occur during I.V. administration of solutions containing about 30 mmol or more potassium per litre. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps may occur following oral administration."
Posaconazole,"Posaconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane. It inhibits the cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme Lanosterol 14-α-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane, thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane.","Common treatment-emergent adverse reactions in studies with Posaconazole are diarrhea, nausea, fever, vomiting, headache, coughing and hypokalemia."
Ponatinib Hydrochloride,"Ponatinib is a kinase inhibitor. Ponatinib inhibited the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity of ABL and T315I mutant ABL with IC 50 concentrations of 0.4 nM and 2.0 nM, respectively. Ponatinib inhibited the in vitro activity of additional kinases with IC 50 concentrations between 0.1 nM and 20 nM, including members of the VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, EPH receptors and SRC families of kinases, and KIT, RET, TIE2, and FLT3. Ponatinib inhibited the in vitro viability of cells expressing native or mutant BCR-ABL, including T315I. In mice, treatment with ponatinib reduced the size of tumors expressing native or T315I mutant BCR-ABL when compared to controls.","The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (≥20%) were, abdominal pain, rash, constipation, headache, dry skin, arterial occlusion, fatigue, hypertension, pyrexia, arthralgia, nausea, diarrhea, lipase increased, vomiting, myalgia and pain in extremity."
Polysaccharide Pneumococcal Vaccine,"Pneumococcal Vaccine induces type-specific antibodies that enhanced opsonization, phagocytosis, and killing of pneumococci by leukocytes and other phagocytic cells. The levels of antibodies that correlate with protection against pneumococcal disease have not been clearly defined.","The most common adverse reactions, reported in >10% of subjects vaccinated with p neumococcal vaccine for the first time in a clinical trial, were: injection-site pain/soreness/tenderness (60.0%), injection-site swelling/ induration (20.3%), headache (17.6%), injection-site erythema (16.4%), asthenia and fatigue (13.2%), and myalgia (11.9%)."
Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine,"The presence of bactericidal anti-capsular meningococcal antibodies has been associated with protection from invasive meningococcal disease. Menactra induces the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the capsular polysaccharides of serogroups A, C, Y and W-135.","Common (≥10%): solicited adverse events in infants and toddlers 9 and 12 months of age were injection site tenderness, erythema, and swelling; irritability, abnormal crying, drowsiness, appetite loss, vomiting, and fever.Common (≥10%): solicited adverse events in individuals 2 through 55 years of age who received a single dose were injection site pain, redness, induration, and swelling; anorexia and diarrhea. Other common solicited adverse events were irritability and drowsiness (2-10 years of age), headache, fatigue, malaise, and arthralgia (11-55 years of age)."
Polygeline + Electrolytes,This Infusion injection comprises of a combination of medicines. It is given as a short term fluid replacement after trauma. This Infusion works by replenishing the body’s fluid and electrolytes. This injection should be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional. You should not self administer this injection.,"Some common side effects of this medicine can be injection site reactions such as redness, pain or swelling. If these side effects persist for a longer duration, please consult your doctor."
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 + Electrolytes,"Polyethylene Glycol 3350 exerts an osmotic action in the gut, which induces a laxative effect. Polyethylene Glycol 3350 increases the stool volume, which triggers colon motility via neuromuscular pathways. Electrolytes combined with Polyethylene Glycol 3350 are exchanged across the intestinal barrier (mucosa) with serum electrolytes and excreted in fecal water without net gain or loss of sodium, potassium and water.Sodium chloride is the major extracellular cation. It is important in electrolyte and fluid balance, osmotic pressure control and water distribution as it restores sodium ions. It is used as a source of electrolytes and water for hydration, treatment of metabolic acidosis, priming solution in haemodialysis and treatment of hyperosmolar diabetes. It is also used as diluents for infusion of compatible drug additives. Sodium bicarbonate raises blood and urinary pH by dissociation to provide bicarbonate ions, which neutralises the hydrogen ion concentration. It also neutralises gastric acid via production of carbon dioxide.Potassium chloride is a major cation of the intracellular fluid. It plays an active role in the conduction of nerve impulses in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle; contraction of cardiac skeletal and smooth muscles; maintenance of normal renal function, acid-base balance, carbohydrate metabolism and gastric secretion.","Generally well tolerated. However side effects like allergic reactions, electrolyte disturbances particularly hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, peripheral edema may appear."
Polyethylene Glycol + Propylene Glycol,"The combination of Polyethylene Glycol 400 & Propylene Glycol is clinically proven to reduce both signs and symptoms of dry eye. The mechanism of action is thought to be due to its unique gelling and lubricating system formulated to adjust to each users individual tear pH. When the ingredients of this eye drops combine with natural tears, a soft gel forms a network of protection over the eye surface. Since it promotes a healthy environment in eye surfaces, damaged surface cells of eye can repair more easily.",Generally well tolerated. This sterile eye drops should not be used if allergic condition occurs to any ingredients of the product.
Polyethylene Glycol,"The primary mode of action is thought to be through the osmotic effect of polyethylene glycol 3350 which causes water to be retained in the colon and produces a watery stool. Polyethylene Glycol induces as diarrhea which rapidly cleanses the bowel, usually within four hours.","Nausea, abdominal bloating, cramping and flatulence may occur. High doses may produce diarrhea and excessive stool frequency, particularly in elderly nursing home patients. Patients taking other medications containing polyethylene glycol have occasionally developed urticaria suggestive of an allergic reaction."
Proparacaine Hydrochloride,"The main site of anesthetic action is the nerve cell membrane where proparacaine interferes with the large transient increase in the membrane permeability to sodium ions that is normally produced by a slight depolarization of the membrane. As the anesthetic action progressively develops in a nerve, the threshold for electrical stimulation gradually increases and the safety factor for conduction decreases; when this action is sufficiently well developed, block of conduction is produced. Several studies indicate that local anesthetics may limit sodium ion permeability by closing the pores through which the ions migrate in the lipid layer of the nerve cell membrane.","Occasional temporary stinging, burning and conjunctival redness may occur with the use of Proparacaine."
Propantheline Bromide,"Propantheline Bromide acts by dual mechanism of action.

Specific anticholinergic effect (antimuscarinic) at the acetylcholine-receptor sites
Direct effect upon smooth muscle (musculotropic).

This medication is a muscarinic antagonist having antispasmodic properties. It reduces the effect of acetylcholine, a chemical released from nerves that stimulates muscles, by blocking the receptors for acetylcholine on smooth muscle. It also has a direct relaxing effect on smooth muscle. In addition, Propantheline inhibits gastrointestinal motility and decreases gastric acid secretion and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Other secretions like pancreatic juice, sweat and saliva are also reduced.","The adverse effects of Propantheline Bromide are usually dose-related and are usually reversible when the therapy is discontinued. Variable degrees of dry mouth, dry skin, mydriasis might be noted. Other reported adverse effects include urinary retention, nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, nervousness, mental confusion etc."
Propafenone Hydrochloride,"Propafenone works by slowing the influx of sodium ions into the cardiac muscle cells, causing a decrease in excitability of the cells. Propafenone is more selective for cells with a high rate, but also blocks normal cells more than class Ia or Ib. Propafenone differs from the prototypical class Ic antiarrhythmic in that it has additional activity as a beta-adrenergic blocker which can cause bradycardia and bronchospasm.","Adverse reactions associated with propafenone occur most frequently in the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Change in taste, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, gas, headache, light-headedness, nausea, tiredness etc. may happen. Severe allergic reactions also reported with propafenone."
Promethazine Theoclate,"Promethazine Theoclate works by stopping histamine from binding to its receptors in an area in the brain known as the vomiting centre. The vomiting centre is responsible for causing feelings of sickness and for the vomiting reflex. It is activated when it receives nerve messages from the vestibular apparatus in the middle ear.The vestibular apparatus provides constant feedback to the brain about the position of our body. When something disturbs the vestibular apparatus, such as movements of the head when travelling by boat or car, nerve signals are sent from the vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre. This can cause the symptoms of motion sickness, such as nausea, dizziness or spinning sensations (vertigo) and vomiting.By blocking the histamine receptors in the vomiting centre, Promethazine Theoclate prevents disturbances in the middle ear from activating the vomiting centre.","Medicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with promethazine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using Promethazine Theoclate will experience that or any side effect.

Promethazine Hydrochloride (Injection),"Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative which blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic receptors in the brain. It exhibits strong α-adrenergic blocking effect and depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones. It competes with histamine for the H1-receptor; muscarinic blocking effect may be responsible for antiemetic activity. It also reduces stimuli to the brainstem reticular system.Clinical effects are generally apparent within 5 minutes of an intravenous injection and within 20 minutes of an intramuscular injection. Duration of action is four to six hours, although effects may persist up to 12 hours. Promethazine hydrochloride injection is metabolized in the liver, with the sulfoxides of promethazine and N-desmethylpromethazine being the predominant metabolites appearing in the urine.

Progesterone (Vaginal Pessary),"Micronized Progesterone Vaginal Pessary is structurally and biologically identical to natural endogenous progesterone.

Absorption: Vaginal administration of Progesterone 400 mg every 12 h in healthy women has been shown effective in rapidly achieving and maintaining serum progesterone concentrations at physiological levels appropriate to the mid-luteal phase of the ovarian cycle and early pregnancy.
Distribution: Progesterone is approximately 96 % to 99 % bound to serum proteins, primarily to serum albumin and corticosteroid binding globulin.
Biotransformation: Progesterone is metabolized primarily by the liver largely to pregnanediols and pregnanolones. Pregnanediols and pregnanolones are conjugated in the liver to glucuronide and sulfate metabolites. Progesterone metabolites that are excreted in the bile may be deconjugated and may be further metabolized in the gut via reduction, dehydroxylation and epimerization.
Elimination: Progesterone undergoes renal and biliary elimination.","Micronized Progesterone is devoid of estrogenic, androgenic and mineralocorticoid effects. Mild somnolence and other CNS side effects like depression, breast tenderness and bloating are reported. Side effects are less when vaginal route is used."
Progesterone (Capsule),"Progesterone softgel capsule contains micronised progesterone, which is structurally and biologically identical to natural endogenous progesterone. Micronisation increases the bioavailability of progesterone. When micronised progesterone is administered after meals, maximal serum progesterone levels are significantly increased. Progesterone concentrations in the endometrial and breast tissue attain high level. Progesterone is approximately 96%-99% bound to serum proteins, primarily to serum albumin (50%-54%). Progesterone is metabolized to pregnanediols and pregnanolones in the liver. The glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of pregnanediol and pregnanolone are excreted in the bile and urine. Progesterone metabolites, which are excreted in bile, may undergo enterohepatic circulation.","Progesterone is devoid of estrogenic, androgenic and mineralocorticoid effects. Mild somnolence and other CNS side effects like depression, breast tenderness and bloating are reported. Side effects are less when vaginal route is used."
Procyclidine Hydrochloride,"Procyclidine hydrochloride is an antimuscarinic antiparkinsonian agent of relatively low toxicity. It is a synthetic tertiary amine. This drug exerts their antiparkinsonian effect by correcting the relative cholinergic excess which is thought to occur in parkinsonian as a result of dopamine deficiency. It is absorbed from G.I. tract and disappears rapidly from the tissues. After intravenous administration, it acts within 5 to 20 minutes and has a duration of effect up to 4 hours.","At usual dosage levels dryness of the mouth is generally the only adverse effect. Mydriasis, blurred vision and adverse G.I. effects (nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, constipation) occur occasionally. An allergic reaction (e.g. rash) or muscular weakness may occasionally occur. High doses may cause vertigo and possibly confusion and hallucination. Adverse effect may usually be minimized by adjustment of dosage and administration after meal."
Prochlorperazine Maleate,"Prochlorperazine is a dopamine & histamine antagonist. The mechanism of antiemetic activity is due to the blockade of histamine H, & dopamine D2 neurotransmitter receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and vomiting centre. It also has a weak anticholinergic effect and prevents acid reflux by increasing the tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter.","Drowsiness; jaw, neck, and back muscle spasms; fine worm-like tongue movements; rhythmic face, mouth, or jaw movements; slow or difficult speech; difficulty swallowing; restlessness and pacing; tremors; shuffling walk; skin rash; yellowing of the skin or eyes."
Procaine Penicillin + Benzyl Penicillin,"Benzylpenicillin has a bactericidal action against gram-positive bacteria, gram-­negative cocci, some other gram-negative bacteria, spirochetes and actinomycetes. It inhibits final cross-linking stage of peptidoglycan production through binding and inactivation of transpeptidases on the inner surface of the bacterial cell membrane thus inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. It is inhibited by penicillinase and other lactamases.Interferes with cell wall mucopeptide synthesis during active multiplication, resulting in bactericidal activity against susceptible microorganisms.",Allergic reactions may occur but usually resolve on cessation of therapy.
Probiotic Combination [9 Billion],"The antimicrobial activity of probiotics is thought to be accounted for, in large part, by their ability to colonize the colon and reinforce the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa. In addition, some probiotics have been found to secrete antimicrobial substances known as bacteriocins. It reduced gastrointestinal pH through stimulation of lactic acid producing bacteria and provides a direct antagonistic action on GI pathogen. Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Bifidobaterium, have also demonstrated antioxidative ability.

Primaquine Phosphate,"Primaquine is an 8-aminoquinoline antimalarial which eliminates the exoerythrocytic forms of malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium falciparum by disrupting mitochondria and binding to DNA.Primaquine's mechanism of action is not well understood. It may be acting by generating reactive oxygen species or by interfering with the electron transport in the parasite. Also, although its mechanism of action is unclear, primaquine may bind to and alter the properties of protozoal DNA.","Abdominal pain, gastric distress, nausea, vomiting; methaemoglobinaemia, haemolytic anaemia (in patients with G6PD deficiency), mild anaemia, leucocytosis; HTN, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged QT interval on ECG, accommodation disturbance. Rarely, leucopenia, agranulocytosis."
Pregabalin,"Pregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.","Most common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite."
Prednisolone Acetate,Prednisolone decreases inflammation by inhibition of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It suppresses the immune system by reducing the activity and production of the lymphocytes and eosinophils.,"Elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage, posterior subcapsular cataract formation and delayed wound healing.  Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly may develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroid."
Prednisolone + Neomycin Sulphate + Polymixin B Sulphate,Prednisolone decreases inflammation by inhibition of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It suppresses the immune system by reducing the activity and production of the lymphocytes and eosinophils.Neomycin: Interferes with bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 30S ribosomal subunits.Polymixin B Sulphate: Bactericidal; causes leakage of bacterial membrane,"Elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage, posterior subcapsular cataract formation and delayed wound healing.Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly may develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroid"
Rabeprazole Sodium,"Rabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.","In general, Rabeprazole is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Rabeprazole may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness."
Rabeprazole + Amoxicillin + Clarithromycin,"Amoxicillin is similar to penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria.Clarithromycin acts by inhibiting microsomal protein synthesis in susceptible organisms mainly by binding to the donor site on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and preventing translocation to that site.Rabeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds (substituted benzimidazole proton-pump inhibitors) that do not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine H2-receptor antagonist properties, but suppress gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+,K+ ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor. Rabeprazole blocks the final step of gastric acid secretion.","Adverse reactions which were reported as possibly or probably related to treatment (<3%) in clinical trials when all three components of this therapy were given concomitantly are listed below and divided by body systems. Digestive system: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dark stools, dry mouth, glossitis, oral moniliasis, stomatitis, tongue discoloration; Musculoskeletal system: Myalgia; Nervous System: Confusion, headache, dizziness; Skin: Skin reactions; Urogenital System: Vaginitis, vaginal moniliasis."
Quinine Sulfate,Quinine is believed to interfere with protein metabolism and inhibits nucleic acid synthesis in malarial parasites. Quinine is a highly active blood schizonticide and suppresses the asexual cycle of development of malaria parasites in the erythrocytes. It is effective both as a suppressive drug and in the over clinical attack of malaria.,"Cinchonism which includes tinnitus, headache, nausea and visual disturbances. Hematological disorders and skin reaction may occur."
Quetiapine Fumarate,"The mechanism of action of Quetiapine, as with other drugs having efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia and acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2 ) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT 2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other effects of Quetiapine. Quetiapine's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Quetiapine's antagonism of adrenergic α1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.","The most commonly reported Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) with Quetiapine are somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, withdrawal (discontinuation) symptoms, elevations in serum triglyceride levels, elevations in total cholesterol (predominantly LDL cholesterol), decreases in HDL cholesterol, weight gain, decreased haemoglobin and extrapyramidal symptoms."
Pyrimethamine,"Pyrimethamine is a folic acid antagonist structurally similar to trimethoprim. It inhibits parasitic dihydrofolate reductase, thus inhibiting vital tetrahydrofolic acid synthesis. It is active against pre-erythrocytic forms and is also a slow-acting schizontocide.","Hypersensitivity reactions, occasionally severe (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and anaphylaxis), and hyperphenylalaninemia, can occur particularly when pyrimethamine is administered concomitantly with a sulfonamide. Consult the complete prescribing information for the relevant sulfonamide for sulfonamideassociated adverse events. With doses of pyrimethamine used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis, anorexia and vomiting may occur. Vomiting may be minimized by giving the medication with meals; it usually disappears promptly upon reduction of dosage. Doses used in toxoplasmosis may produce megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, atrophic glossitis, hematuria, and disorders of cardiac rhythm."
Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Doxylamine Succinate,Doxylamine Succinate is an antihistamine that blocks Histamine (H1) receptor. It can cross the blood brain barrier and has a high affinity for H1 receptors in the brain that blocks H1 receptors. It also decreases the action of histamine at the H1 receptor by inhibiting both vestibular system & Muscarinic receptor. It affects the vestibular system & decreases the stimulation of the vomiting center. Its muscarinic receptor inhibition may also play a role in antihistamine antiemetic activity. Pyridoxine Hydrochloride is a vitamin B6 analog. It is used to prevent nausea and vomiting due to its antiemetic properties.,Somnolence or other accidents resulting from the effect of the combined use of Doxylamine Succinate & Pyridoxine Hydrochloride with CNS depressants.
Pyridoxine Hydrochloride,"Pyridoxine is a water-soluble vitamin which functions in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. It is essential in Hb formation and GABA synthesis within the CNS. It also aids in the release of glycogen stored in the liver and muscles.","Pyridoxine usually has no side effects when used in recommended doses.If your doctor has prescribed this medication, remember that he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.Pyridoxine can cause side effects when taken in large doses for a long time. Tell your doctor right away if any of these unlikely but serious side effects occur: headache, nausea, drowsiness, numbness/tingling of arms/legs.A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, seek immediate medical attention if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing.This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist."
Pyridostigmine Bromide,"Pyridostigmine tablet is an orally active cholinesterase inhibitor. Pyridostigmine inhibits the destruction of acetylcholine by cholinesterase and thereby permits freer transmission of nerve impulses across the neuromuscular junction. Pyridostigmine is an analog of neostigmine, but differs from it in certain clinically significant respects; for example, Pyridostigmine is characterized by a longer duration of action and fewer gastrointestinal side effects.","The side effects of Pyridostigmine are most commonly related to overdosage and generally are of two varieties, muscarinic and nicotinic. Among those in the former group are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, increased peristalsis, increased salivation, increased bronchial secretions, miosis and diaphoresis. Nicotinic side effects are comprised chiefly of muscle cramps, fasciculation and weakness. Muscarinic side effects can usually be counteracted by atropine, but for reasons shown in the preceding section the expedient is not without danger. As with any compound containing the bromide radical, a skin rash may be seen in an occasional patient. Such reactions usually subside promptly upon discontinuance of the medication."
Pyrazinamide,"Pyrazinamide may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in action, depending on the concentration of the drug attained at the site of the infection and the susceptibility of the infecting organism. Its activity appears to partly depend on conversion of the drug to pyrazinoic acid (POA), which lowers the pH of the environment below that which is necessary for growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Susceptible strains of M. tuberculosis produce pyrazinamidase, an enzyme that deaminates pyrazinamide to POA, and the in vitro susceptibility of a given strain of the organism appears to correspond to its pyrazinamidase activity.","General: Fever, porphyria and dysuria have rarely been reported. Gout.Gastrointestinal: The principal adverse effect is a hepatic reaction. Hepatotoxicity appears to be dose related, and may appear at any time during therapy. GI disturbances including nausea, vomiting and anorexia have also been reported.Hematologic and Lymphatic: Thrombocytopenia and sideroblastic anemia with erythroid hyperplasia, vacuolation of erythrocytes and increased serum iron concentration have occurred rarely with this drug. Adverse effects on blood clotting mechanisms have also been rarely reported.Other: Mild arthralgia and myalgia have been reported frequently. Hypersensitivity reactions including rashes, urticaria, and pruritis have been reported. Fever, acne, photosensitivity, porphyria, dysuria and interstitial nephritis have been reported rarely."
Pyrantel Pamoate,"Pyrantel pamoate acts as a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, thereby causing sudden contraction, followed by paralysis, of the helminths. This has the result of causing the worm to ""lose its grip"" on the intestinal wall and be passed out of the system by natural process. Since Pyrantel is poorly absorbed by the host's intestine, the host is unaffected by the small dosage of medication used. Spastic (tetanic) paralyzing agents, in particular pyrantel pamoate, may induce complete intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. This obstruction is usually in the form of a worm impaction and happens when a very small, but heavily parasitized animal is treated and tries to pass a large number of dislodged worms at once. Worms usually pass in normal stool or with diarrhea, straining, and occasional vomiting.","Pyrantel Pamoate is well tolerated in recommended dosage. When given in large dosage, Pyrantel Pamoate may cause gastrointestinal upset such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Other side effects that may occur in rare occasions are headache, dizziness and rash."
Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride,"Pseudoephedrine is both an α-and β-adrenergic receptor agonist. It causes vasoconstriction via direct stimulation of α-adrenergic receptors of the respiratory mucosa. It also directly stimulates β-adrenergic receptors causing bronchial relaxation, increased heart rate and contractility.Like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine releasing norepinephrine from its storage sites, an indirect effect. This is its main and direct mechanism of action. The displaced noradrenaline is released into the neuronal synapse where it is free to activate the postsynaptic adrenergic receptors.","Serious adverse effects associated with the use of Pseudoephedrine are rare. Symptoms of central nervous system excitation may occur, including sleep disturbances and, rarely, hallucinations have been reported. Skin rashes, with or without irritation, have occasionally been reported."
Pseudoephedrine + Guaiphenasine + Triprolidine,"Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant as well as a bronchodilator for the upper respiratory tract, which gives symptomatic relief of nasal congestion. Pseudoephedrine is both an α-and β-adrenergic receptor agonist. It causes vasoconstriction via direct stimulation of α-adrenergic receptors of the respiratory mucosa. It also directly stimulates β-adrenergic receptors causing bronchial relaxation, increased heart rate and contractility.Like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine releasing norepinephrine from its storage sites, an indirect effect. This is its main and direct mechanism of action. The displaced noradrenaline is released into the neuronal synapse where it is free to activate the postsynaptic adrenergic receptors.Guaifenesin reduces the viscosity of tenacious sputum and is used as an expectorant. It increases the hydration of respiratory tract, thereby increasing the volume and reducing the viscosity of bronchial secretions.Triprolidine is an antihistamine; it is used for the symptomatic relief of hypersensitivity reactions including rhinitis, conjunctivitis and urticaria.","CNS depression or excitation, drowsiness (reported most frequently), sleep disturbances, hallucinations (rarely reported), skin rashes with or without irritation, tachycardia, dryness of mouth, nose and throat have occasionally been reported."
Prucalopride Succinate,"Prucalopride acts as a selective stimulator of the 5-HT4 receptors while having no interaction with hERG channel or 5-HT1 receptors which reduces significantly the cardiovascular risk found in other similar drugs. 5-HT4 receptors can be found throughout the gastrointestinal tract primarily in smooth muscle cells, enterochromaffin cells, and myenteric plexus. Its activation produces the release of acetylcholine which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the GI tract. Hence, prucalopride stimulates motility by interacting specifically with 5-HT4 receptors in the GI tract which causes a release of acetylcholine and further contraction of the muscle layer of the colon and relaxation of the circular muscle layer leading to the propulsion of luminal content.","The most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with Prucalopride therapy are headache (17.8%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain), nausea and diarrhoea. The adverse reactions occur predominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear within a few days with continued treatment. Other adverse reactions have been reported occasionally. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity."
Protamine Sulfate,"Protamine sulfate is prepared from the sperm or mature testes of salmon or related species and is composed of arginine, proline, serine and valine. It combines with strongly acidic heparin to form a stable complex, neutralising the anticoagulant activity of both drugs.","Intravenous injections of Protamine sulfate may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure, bradycardia, pulmonary hypertension, dyspnea, or transitory flushing and a feeling of warmth. There have been reports of anaphylaxis that resulted in respiratory embarrassment. Other reported adverse reactions include systemic hypertension, nausea, vomiting and lassitude. Back pain has been reported rarely in conscious patients undergoing such procedures as cardiaccatheterization. Because fatal reactions often resembling anaphylaxis have been reported after administration of Protamine sulfate, the drug should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available."
Protamine Crystallised Insulin Aspart,The primary activity of Insulin Aspart is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin Aspart bind to the insulin receptors on muscle and fat cells and lower blood glucose by facilitating the cellular uptake of glucose and simultaneously inhibiting the output of glucose from the liver.,"Side effects of Insulin Aspart are hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus and rash."
Propylthiouracil,"Propylthiouracil inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones and thus is effective in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. The drug does not inactivate existing thyroxine and triiodothyronine that are stored in the thyroid or circulating in the blood, nor does it interfere with the effectiveness of thyroid hormones given by mouth or by injection. Propylthiouracil inhibits the conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine in peripheral tissues and may therefore be an effective treatment for thyroid storm. Propylthiouracil is readily absorbed and is extensively metabolized. Approximately 35% of the drug is excreted in the urine, in intact and conjugated forms, within 24 hours.","The most common side effects of Propylthiouracil include:

nausea
muscle pain
vomiting
headache
upper stomach pain or tenderness
sleepiness
joint pain
nerve pain
itching or tingling
swelling (edema)
loss or change in taste
dizziness
loss of hair
enlarged salivary glands or enlarged lymph node"
Propranolol Hydrochloride,"Propranolol Hydrochloride is a B-adrenergic receptor blocking drug which is widely used in hypertension and angina pectoris. Propranolol antagonizes catecholamines at B-adrenergic receptors, thus prevents excess rate and force of contraction of the heart and decreases the excess consumption of oxygen by the heart.Propranolol is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but a portion is immediately metabolized by the liver when passing through the portal circulation. Peak plasma concentration occurs in 1 to 1.5 hours after oral administration. The plasma half-life of propranolol is from 3 to 6 hours. The metabolites of propranolol are excreted through the urine.","Cold extremities, lassitude, nausea, dizziness, insomnia, paresthesia etc."
Propofol,"Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic agent for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia or sedation. Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol produces hypnosis rapidly with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of an injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation). The action of propofol involves a positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter gama-aminobutyric acid (GABA) through GABA-A receptors.","Local: Propofol is normally well tolerated. Its most common undesirable effect is pain at the site of injection that can be reduced by mixing the preparation with lidocaine or by injecting it into one of the larger veins of the forearm or the intercubital fossa. Thrombosis and phlebitis are rare. General: Hypotension and transient apnea may occur at the induction of anaesthesia, and may be severe especially in patients who are in a poor general condition. Epileptic movement, convulsions and dystonic reactions have been seen in rare cases. Pulmonary oedema has also been reported. Headache, nausea and, more rarely, vomiting may occur in some patients during recovery. Recovery may also be associated with another short period of impaired consciousness. Hypersensitivity has been reported in some cases, connected with anaphylactic symptoms such as marked hypotension, bronchospasm, oedema and facial erythema. Some cases of cardiac arrest have occurred in connection with the administration of propofol. In connection with long-term administration of propofol, green or reddish brown discolouration of urine may occur. This is caused by the quinol metabolites of propofol, and is not dangerous. As with other anaesthetics, altered sexual behaviour may occur."
Ribavirin,"Ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside which has inhibitory action against respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus and herpes simplex virus. The mechanism of action is not clear. It may act at several sites including cellular enzymes to interfere with viral nucleic acid synthesis. The mono- and triphosphate derivatives are known to be responsible for the antiviral action of the compound.","The most common adverse reactions in adults receiving combination therapy are psychiatric and central nervous system effects, severe ocular disorder, dental and periodontal disorders & growth inhibition in children and adolescents that may be irreversible in some patients. The most common adverse reactions in pediatric subjects were similar to those seen in adults."
Rhubarb Extract + Salicylic Acid,"Salicylic acid works by blocking the action of a substance in the body called cyclo-oxygenase. This extract contains anthraquinone glycosides, which relieve inflammation. This is well absorb into the oral mucosa.",A transient local burning sensation at the site of application occurs very commonly. Temporary discoloration of teeth or oral mucosa has been described commonly following administration of the oral solution.
Retapamulin,"Retapamulin selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interacting at a site on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome through an interaction that is different from that of other antibiotics. This binding site involves ribosomal protein L3 and is in the region of the ribosomal P-site and peptidyl transferase center. By virtue of binding to this site, pleuromutilins inhibit peptidyl transfer, block P-site interactions, and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits. Retapamulin is bacteriostatic against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes at the Retapamulin in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for these organisms.",Adverse effects: Application site irritation (<2% of patients may experience).
Repaglinide,"Repaglinide binds to specific receptors in the cell membrane leading to the closure of ATP dependent K+ channels and the depolarisation of cell membrane. This in turn, leads to Ca++ influx, increased intracellular Ca++ and the stimulation of insulin secretion.","The most common side effects of Repaglinide are hypoglycemia and related symptoms. Others include upper respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, constipation, nausea and vomiting. Hypersensitivity reactions include rashes and urticaria."
Remdesivir,"Remdesivir is a preparation of Remdesivir. It is an adenosine nucleotide prodrug that distributes into cells where it is metabolized to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite. Metabolism of Remdesivir to Remdesivir Triphosphate has been demonstrated in multiple cell types. Remdesivir Triphosphate act as an analogue of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and competes with the natural ATP substrate for incorporation into nascent RNA chains by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which results in delayed chain termination during replication of the viral RNA. Remdesivir triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA and RNA polymerase with low potential for mitochondrial toxicity.",An adverse reaction associated with Remdesivir in clinical trials in healthy adult subjects was increased liver transaminases.
Relugolix,"Relugolix is a non-peptide small molecule, GnRH receptor antagonist. Relugolix competitively binds to pituitary GnRH receptors, thereby, reducing the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and consequently testosterone.Absorption: Relugolix is a substrate for intestinal P-gp. The mean (CV%) absolute bioavailability of Relugolix is approximately 12%. The median (range) Tmax of Relugolix is 2.25 hours.Effect of Food: No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of Relugolix were observed following consumption of a high-calorie, high-fat meal.Distribution: Plasma protein binding of Relugolix is 68 to 71%, primarily to albumin and to a lesser extent to α1- acid glycoprotein.

Regorafenib,"Regorafenib is a kinase inhibitor and it inhibits multiple membrane-bound and intracellular kinases involved in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, tumor angiogenesis, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. Regorafenib or its major human active metabolites M-2 and M-5 inhibits the activity of RET, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, KIT, PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, FGFR1, FGFR2, TIE2, DDR2, Trk2A, Eph2A, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAFV600E, SAPK2, PTK5, and Abl. Due to its inhibitory functions, regorafenib can inhibit the progression of certain solid tumors.","The most common side effects (≥30%) are asthenia/fatigue, decreased appetite and food intake, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) [palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE)], diarrhea, mucositis, weight loss, infection, hypertension, and dysphonia."
Red Clover [Trifolium Pratense],"Red Clover extracts act as an estrogen agonist by binding to intracellular estradiol receptors. it was defined as an antiprogestin, due to the extract's inhibition of progesterone induction of alkaline phosphate, an end product of progestin activity. Red Clover increases uterine weight and decreased cervical mucus viscoelasticity.Red Clover (Trifolium pratense) is a herbal extract, which is high in isoflavones (natural plant estrogens). Red Clover isoflavones mimic the action of estrogens and are widely used by women to maintain their health and vitality especially during the time of menopause. Red Clover contains 4 key isoflavones (Genistein, Daidzein, Biochanin A and Formonoetin) that help balance female hormones by mimicking the effects of estrogens in the body, which in turn help support women during menopause. Unlike traditional hormone therapy (HRT), these natural plant estrogens prefer to bond with beta estrogens receptors and show no affinity to bond with alpha estrogens receptors.","General side effects may include headache, nausea and rash. Due to its coumarin derivatives, Trifolium Pratense should be used with caution in individuals with coagulation disorders or currently undergoing anticoagulation therapy."
Recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (rFSH),"rFSH is a Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) preparation of recombinant DNA origin, which consists of two non-covalently linked, nonidentical glycoproteins designated as the α- and β subunits. The α- and β-subunits have 92 and 111 amino acids respectively, and their primary and tertiary structure are indistinguishable from those of human Follicle Stimulating Hormone. Recombinant FSH production occurs in genetically modified Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells cultured in bioreactors. Purification by immunochromatography using an antibody specifically binding FSH results in a highly purified preparation with a consistent FSH isoform profile and a high specific activity. The biological activity of rFSH is determined by measuring the increase in ovary weight in female rats. The in vivo biological activity of rFSH has been calibrated against the first International Standard for Recombinant Human Follicle Stimulating Hormone established in 1995 by the Expert Committee on Biological Standards of the World Health Organization. rFSH contains no Luteinizing Hormone (LH) activity.","Recombinant FSH sometimes excites the ovaries too much. This may cause pelvic pain or breathing problems. It may also make you urinate less. In rare cases, patients with this problem have had serious lung problems, including fluid in the lungs, troublebreathing, and worsening of asthma blood clots, Severe Pelvic pain, Chest pain, or Abdominal pain, Nausea, Vomiting, Sudden weight gain, Bloating, Trouble, Breathing. Recombinant FSH may cause twins or multiple births."
Rasagiline,"Rasagiline is a potent, irreversible, selective MAO-B inhibitor that effectively crosses the blood brain barrier after oral administration. The precise mechanisms of action of Rasagiline are unknown. One mechanism is believed to be related to its MAO-B inhibitory activity, which causes an increase in extracellular levels of dopamine in the brain. The elevated dopamine level and subsequent increased dopaminergic activity are likely to mediate Rasagiline's beneficial effects.","Common side effects of Rasagiline include: dizziness, spinning sensation, joint pain, headache, heartburn, nausea, muscle pain etc."
Ranolazine,"Ranolazine has anti-ischemlc and antlanginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure.The exact mechanism of action of ranolazine is unknown. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (INa). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain.The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of IKr which prolongs the ventricular action potential.","Cardiac Disorders: bradycardia, palpitationsEar and Labyrinth Disorders: tinnitus, vertigoGastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomitingGeneral Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events: peripheral edemaRespiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders: dyspneaVascular Disorders: hypotension, orthostatic hypotension"

Ramucirumab,"Ramucirumab is a VEGFR2 antagonist that specifically binds VEGFR2 and blocks binding of VEGFR ligands, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D. As a result, ramucirumab inhibits ligand-stimulated activation of VEGFR2, thereby inhibiting ligand-induced proliferation, and migration of human endothelial cells. Ramucirumab inhibited angiogenesis in an in vivo animal model.","The most common adverse reactions observed in single agent Ramucirumab-treated gastric cancer patients at a rate of ≥10% and ≥2% higher than placebo were hypertension and diarrhea.The most common adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Ramucirumab with paclitaxel at a rate of ≥30% and ≥2% higher than placebo with paclitaxel were fatigue/asthenia, neutropenia, diarrhea, and epistaxis.The most common adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Ramucirumab with erlotinib at a rate of ≥30% and ≥2% higher than placebo with erlotinib were, infections, hypertension, stomatitis, proteinuria, alopecia, and epistaxis. The most common laboratory abnormalities at a rate of ≥30% and ≥2% higher difference in incidence between arms were increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.The most common adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Ramucirumab with docetaxel at a rate of ≥30% and ≥2% higher than placebo with docetaxel were neutropenia, fatigue/asthenia, and stomatitis/mucosal inflammation.The most common adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Ramucirumab with FOLFIRI at a rate of ≥30% and ≥2% higher than placebo with FOLFIRI were diarrhea, neutropenia, decreased appetite, epistaxis, and stomatitis.The most common adverse reactions observed in single agent Ramucirumab-treated HCC patients at a rate of ≥15% and ≥2% higher than placebo were fatigue, peripheral edema, hypertension, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, proteinuria, nausea, and ascites. The most common laboratory abnormalities at a rate of ≥30% and a ≥2% higher difference in incidence between arms were thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyponatremia."
Ramipril + Hydrochlorothiazide,"Ramipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of anangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.","The combination of Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide is generally well tolerated. Side effects commonly reported include headache, dizziness, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, cough, weakness, diarrhoea, fever, gastric irritation, pulmonary oedema, photosensitivity, electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycaemia, hyperuricaemia and vertigo."

Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely."
Ramelteon,"Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist with both high affinity for melatonin MT1 and MT2receptors, and lower selectivity for the MT3 receptor. Melatonin production is concurrent with nocturnal sleep, meaning that an increase in melatonin levels is related to the onset of self-reported sleepiness and an increase in sleep propensity. MT1 receptors are believed to be responsible for regulation of sleepiness and facilitation of sleep onset, and MT2 receptors are believed to mediate phase-shifting effects of melatonin on the circadian rhythm. While MT1 and MT2 receptors are associated with the sleep-wake cycle, MT3 has a completely different profile, and therefore is not likely to be involved in the sleep-wake cycle. Remelteon has no appreciable affinity for the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex or receptors that bind neuropeptides, cytokines, serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, or opiates.","Most common adverse reactions (≥3% and more common than with placebo) are: somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and exacerbated insomnia"
Racepinephrine,"Racepinephrine is an alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor stimulant. Racepinephrine works by widening the airways, reducing spasms of bronchial muscles of asthma patients, which makes it easier to breathe.","Side effects of Racepinephrine includes headache, loss of appetite, nausea & vomiting, nervousness, tremors, trouble sleeping, fear, agitation, anxiety, restlessness, dizziness, impaired memory, hallucinations, and psychosis. Severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, and difficulty in breathing, swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue), chest pain, fast heartbeat and wheezing may occur. Besides, elevations of heart rate and blood pressure or arrhythmias may occur. Cardiac patients with coronary artery disease or hypertension may worsen condition."
Racecadotril,Racecadotril increases the availability of endogenous opioids (enkephalins) by inhibiting the membrane-bound enkephalinase. The enkephalins in turn mediate their effect through δ receptor ( delta opioid receptor) activation that induces a selective increase in Cl absorption by inhibiting adenylate cyclase.Onset: 30 min (plasma enkephalinase inhibition).,"Headache, erythema multiforme, urticaria, angioedema may be seen."
Rabies Vaccine,"Rabies Vaccine for human use is a freeze-dried preparations of inactivated rabies virus produced on Vero cell.

Moderate fever, shivering, fainting, asthenia, dizziness, respiratory manifestations (dyspnoea, wheezing), fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and allergic skin reactions (urticaria, rash, itching)."
Roflumilast,"Roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor which, due to its selective inhibition of the PDE4 isoenzyme, has potential antiinflammatory and antimodulatory effects in the pulmonary system. It is thought that the increased levels of intracellular cyclic AMP are responsible for the therapeutic actions of Roflumilast.","General disorders: Fatigue.Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Decreased appetite, Weight decreased.Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Back pain, muscle spasms.Nervous system disorders: Dizziness, Headache, Tremor.Psychiatric disorders: Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia."
Rocuronium Bromide,"Rocuronium acts by competing for cholinergic receptors at the motor end-plate. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine and edrophonium. Rocuronium acts by competitively binding to nicotinic cholinergic receptors. The binding of vecuronium decreases the opportunity for acetylcholine to bind to the nicotinic receptor at the postjunctional membrane of the myoneural junction. As a result, depolarization is prevented, calcium ions are not released and muscle contraction does not occur. Evidence also suggests that nondepolarizing agents can affect ACh release. It has been hypothesized that nondepolarzing agents bind to postjunctional (""curare"") receptors and may therefore interfere with the sodium and potassium flux, which is responsible for depolarization and repolarization of the membranes involved in muscle contraction.","In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (2%) are transient hypotension and hypertension. Other are:

Anaphylaxis 
Residual paralysis 
Myopathy 
Increased pulmonary vascular resistance

Although very rare, severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including Rocuronium Bromide, have been reported. Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions are: bronchospasm, cardiovascular changes (e.g. hypotension, tachycardia, circulatory collapse - shock), and cutaneous changes (e.g. angioedema, urticaria). These reactions have, in some cases, been fatal. Due to the possible severity of these reactions, one should always assume they may occur and take the necessary precautions. Since neuromuscular blocking agents are known to be capable of inducing histamine release both locally at the site of injection and systemically, the possible occurrence of itching and erythematosus reactions at the site of injection and/or generalized histaminoid (anaphylactoid) reactions (see also under Anaphylactic Reactions above) should always be taken into consideration when administering these agents. In clinical studies only a slight increase in mean plasma histamine levels has been observed following rapid bolus administration of 0.3 0.9mg/kg Rocuronium Bromide.Prolonged neuromuscular block: The most frequent adverse reaction to nondepolarizing blocking agents as a class consists of an extension of the agent's pharmacological action beyond the time period needed. This may vary from skeletal muscle weakness to profound and prolonged skeletal muscle paralysis resulting in respiratory insufficiency or apnoea. Myopathy: Myopathy has been reported after the use of various neuromuscular blocking agents in the ICU in combination with corticosteroids.Local injection site reactions: During rapid sequence induction of anesthesia, pain on injection has been reported, especially when the patient has not yet completely lost consciousness and particularly when propofol is used as the induction agent. In clinical studies, pain on injection has been noted in 16% of the patients who underwent rapid sequence induction of anesthesia with propofol and in less than 0.5% of the patients who underwent rapid sequence induction of anesthesia with fentanyl and thiopental."
Rizatriptan Benzoate,Rizatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT1B/1D receptors. Rizatriptan Benzoate presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache by binding to 5-HT1B/1D receptors located on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system.,"The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:

Rivastigmine Tartrate,"Rivastigmine is a carbamate derivative that is structurally related to physostigmine, but not to donepezil and tacrine. The precise mechanism of rivastigmine has not been fully determined, but it is suggested that rivastigmine binds reversibly with and inactivates chlolinesterase (eg. acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase), preventing the hydrolysis of acetycholine, and thus leading to an increased concentration of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The anticholinesterase activity of rivastigmine is relatively specific for brain acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase compared with those in peripheral tissues.","The most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38%) and vomiting (23%), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more susceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss."
Rivaroxaban,"Rivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor. Inhibition of factor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibits thrombin formation. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin (activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated.","The most common side effects of Rivaroxaban have increased chance of bleeding, spinal or epidural hematoma and increased risk of stroke after discontinuation in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation."
Rituximab,"Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody to CD20 antigen which regulates cell cycle initiation. It binds to the antigen on the cell surface, activating complement-dependent B-cell cytotoxicity; and to human Fc receptors, mediating cell killing through an antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.Duration: Detectable in serum 3-6 mth after completion of therapy; B-cell recovery 6-12 mth following completion of therapy.","Reactivation of hepatitis B virus.

Ritodrine Hydrochloride,"A selective β2-adrenoceptor agonist with its main action on the uterus, causing relaxation. It reduces the intensity and frequency of contractions. Heart rate is also increased while diastolic pressure is reduced. May cause bronchial relaxation but this is not clinically significant in its usage.","The common side-effects of ritodrine hydrochloride are nausea, vomiting, flushing, sweating, tremor, hypokalaemia, tachycardia, palpitations, hypotension (left lateral position throughout infusion to minimize risk), uterine bleeding, pulmonary oedema; chest pain or tightness, arrhythmias and salivary gland enlargement. On prolonged administration for several weeks may cause leucopenia and agranulocytosis; liver function abnormalities including increased transaminases and hepatitis."
Risperidone (Oral),"Risperidone is a selective monoaminergic antagonist having a high affinity for serotoninergic 5-HT2 and dopaminergic D2 receptors. Risperidone binds also to alpha1 adrenergic receptors and with lower affinity, to H1 histamine and alpha2 adrenergic receptors. Risperidone has no affinity for 8 cholinergic receptors. Risperidone, as a potent D2 antagonist, improves the positive symptoms of schizophrenia but causes less depression of motor activity. Balanced central serotonin and dopamine antagonism may reduce extrapyramidal side effect liability and extend the therapeutic activity to the negative and affective symptoms of schizophrenia.","Insomnia, agitation, anxiety, headache, less commonly drowsiness, impaired concentration, fatigue, blurred vision, constipation, nausea and vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, hyperprolactinaemia, urine incontinence, tachycardia, hypertension, edema, rash, rhinitis, cerebrovascular accident, neurtropenia and thrombocytopenia have been reported."
Risperidone (Injection),"The mechanism of action of risperidone in schizophrenia is unclear. The drug’s therapeutic activity in schizophrenia could be mediated through a combination of dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2) receptor antagonism. The clinical effect from risperidone results from the combined concentrations of risperidone and its major active metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone (paliperidone). Antagonism at receptors other than D2 and 5HT 2 may explain some of the other effects of risperidone","Increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis

Ringer's Lactate Solution,"Lactated Ringer's solution contains isotonic concentrations of electrolytes in water for inj. It is used for parenteral replacement of extracellular losses of fluid and electrolytes. Lactated Ringer’s Injection, produces a metabolic alkalinizing effect. Lactate ions are metabolized ultimately to carbon dioxide and water, which requires the consumption of hydrogen cations.Calcium chloride is used to prevent or treat negative calcium balance. It also regulates action potential excitation threshold to facilitate nerve and muscle performance.Potassium chloride is a major cation of the intracellular fluid. It plays an active role in the conduction of nerve impulses in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle; contraction of cardiac skeletal and smooth muscles; maintenance of normal renal function, acid-base balance, carbohydrate metabolism and gastric secretion.Sodium chloride is the major extracellular cation. It is important in electrolyte and fluid balance, osmotic pressure control and water distribution as it restores sodium ions. It is used as a source of electrolytes and water for hydration, treatment of metabolic acidosis, priming solution in haemodialysis and treatment of hyperosmolar diabetes. It is also used as diluents for infusion of compatible drug additives.","Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation, and hypervolemia."
Rimexolone,"Rimexolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition of arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. By binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, this drug ultimately leads to changes in genetic transcription involving the lipocortins and prostaglandins.","Reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera.Ocular adverse reactions occurring in 1 - 5% of patients in clinical studies of Rimexolone 1% (rimexolone ophthalmic suspension) included blurred vision, discharge, discomfort, ocular pain, increased intraocular pressure, foreign body sensation, hyperemia and pruritus.Other ocular adverse reactions occurring in less than 1% of patients included sticky sensation, increased fibrin, dry eye, conjunctival edema, corneal staining, keratitis, tearing, photophobia, edema, irritation, corneal ulcer, browache, lid margin crusting, corneal edema, infiltrate, and corneal erosion.Non-ocular adverse reactions occurred in less than 2% of patients.

Rifaximin,"Rifaximin is a semisynthetic, rifamycin-based non-systemic antibiotic. Very little of the drug will pass the gastrointestinal wall into the circulation as is common for other types of orally administered antibiotics. Rifaximin inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis by its action on the beta-subunit of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It shows the same broad spectrum activity as rifamycin which exerts bactericidal action against many species of Gram-positive and Gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.","Side effects include flatulence, headache, abdominal pain, rectal tenesmus, defecation urgency, nausea, constipation, pyrexia, vomiting.

Rifampicin + Isoniazid + Pyrazinamide + Ethambutol,"Rifampicin: It is a semisynthetic derivative of rifamycin, suppresses bacterial RNA synthesis by binding to the β-subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thus inhibiting the attachment of the enzyme to DNA, blocking RNA transcription and elongation. It does not inhibit the counterpart mammalian enzyme.Rifampicin has a bactericidal action and a potent sterilizing effect against both intracellular and extracellular tubercle bacilli. Cross-resistance has been shown only with other rifamycin derivatives.Isoniazid: It kills actively growing tubercle bacilli by inhibiting the biosynthesis of mycolic acids, which are the major components of the bacterial cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Pyrazinamide: Pyrazinamide, an antituberculous drug, is the pyrazine analog of nicotinamide. The precise mechanism of action of pyrazinamide is not known. Its metabolite, pyrazinoic acid, which is less active in vitro may possibly be involved in the in vivo activity of pyrazinamide.Ethambutol: Ethambutol diffuses slowly into actively growing Mycobacteria cells eg, tubercle bacilli. It inhibits the synthesis of 1 or more metabolites, thus causing impaired cell metabolism, arrest cell multiplication and induce cell death. No cross-resistance with other agents has been demonstrated.Spectrum of Activity: Rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, at therapeutic levels, have demonstrated bactericidal activity against both intracellular and extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis organism.","Rifampicin: Reddish discolouration of body fluids, asymptomatic increase in liver enzymes, elevations of BUN & uric acid, hemolysis, hematuria, intestinal nephritis, renal insufficiency, Gl discomfort, CNS effects, hematological changes, skin rash, endocrine effects.Isoniazid: Disturbances of liver function, hepatitis, Gl disturbances, peripheral neuropathy, dizziness, lightheadedness, hematological changes, allergic reactions.

Riboflavin,"Riboflavin or vitamin B2 is an easily absorbed, water-soluble micronutrient with a key role in maintaining human health. Like the other B vitamins, it supports energy production by aiding in the metabolising of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Vitamin B2 is also required for red blood cell formation and respiration, antibody production, and for regulating human growth and reproduction. It is essential for healthy skin, nails, hair growth and general good health, including regulating thyroid activity. Riboflavin also helps in the prevention or treatment of many types of eye disorders, including some cases of cataracts.Binds to riboflavin hydrogenase, riboflavin kinase, and riboflavin synthase. Riboflavin is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN, riboflavin monophosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The antioxidant activity of riboflavin is principally derived from its role as a precursor of FAD and the role of this cofactor in the production of the antioxidant reduced glutathione. Reduced glutathione is the cofactor of the selenium-containing glutathione peroxidases among other things. The glutathione peroxidases are major antioxidant enzymes. Reduced glutathione is generated by the FAD-containing enzyme glutathione reductase.","Riboflavin is likely safe for most people. In some people, Riboflavin can cause the urine to turn a yellow- orange color. When taken in high doses, Riboflavin might cause diarrhea, an increase in urine, and other side effects."
Salmeterol + Fluticasone Propionate,"Salmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airways obstruction. Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition. This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12 hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain which binds to the exo-site of the receptor.Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbaions of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.","As this preparation contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler."
Salicylic Acid + Lactic Acid,"Salicylic acid is a widely used and effective keratolytic, it produces desquamation and destruction of the epithelium by solubilising the intercellular cement of the Stratum Corneum. Lactic acid affects the keratinisation process, reducing hyperkeratosis and is also caustic, leading to the destruction of hyperkeratotic tissue. Collodion is derived from cellulose in a base containing ethanol and ether. It allows easy and accurate application of the product and dries to leave a film which hydrates the tissue and facilitates penetration of the active ingredients.","Stinging, burning, or irritation of the skin,Itching, prolonged use over a large skin area may cause salicylate toxicity, ringing sound in the ears (tinnitus), Diarrhoea, Vomiting."
Salicylic Acid,"Salicylic Acid has a potent keratolytic & a slight antiseptic action when applied topically to the skin. In low concentrations, the drug has keratoplastic activity (correction of abnormal keratinization) & in higher concentrations, the drug has keratolytic activity (causes peeling of skin). Salicylic Acid softens & destroys the stratum corneum by increasing endogenous hydration (water concentration), probably because of decreased pH, which causes the cornified epithelium (horny layer of the skin) to swell, soften, & then desquamate. Necrosis of normal skin has been associated with overuse of the drug. At high concentrations, Salicylic Acid has a caustic effect. Moisture is essential for Salicylic Acid to exert its action on the skin and for maceration and desquamation of epidermal tissue to occur. The drug has weak antifungal & antibacterial activity.","An allergic reaction (shortness of breath, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, face or tongue or hives) or severe skin irritation."
Salbutamol + Ipratropium (Solution for inhalation),Ipratropium Bromide is quickly absorbed after inhalation. The systemic bioavailability following inhalation is estimated to be less than 10% of the dose. Renal excretion of Ipratropium Bromide is given as 46% of the dose after intravenous administration. The half-life of the terminal elimination phase is about 1.6 hours as determined after intravenous administration. Elimination half-life of drug and metabolites is 3.6 hours as determined after radio labelling. Ipratropium Bromide does not penetrate the blood brain barrier.Salbutamoi Sulphate is rapidly and completely absorbed following administration either by inhaled or oral route. Peak plasma Salbutamoi concentrations are seen within three hours of administration and it is excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours. The elimination half-life is 4 hours. Salbutamoi will cross the blood brain barrier reaching concentrations amounting to about five percent of the plasma concentrations.It has been shown that co-nebulisation of Ipratropium Bromide and Salbutamoi Sulphate does not potentiate the systemic absorption of either component and that therefore the additive activity of this solution is due to the combined local effect on the lung following inhalation.,"In common with other beta-agonists containing products, side effects of this solution can include fine tremor of skeletal muscles and nervousness and less frequently tachycardia, dizziness, palpitations or headache, especially in hypersensitive patients.Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from prolonged and/or high dose beta2 agonist therapy.As with use of other inhalation therapy, cough, local irritation and less commonly inhalation induced bronchospasm can occur. As with other beta-mimetics, nausea, vomiting, sweating, weakness and myalgia/muscle cramps may occur. In rare cases decrease in diastolic blood pressure, increase in systolic blood pressure, arrhythmias, particularly after higher doses, may occur.In individual cases psychological alterations have been reported under inhalation therapy with beta-mimetics.The most frequent non-respiratory anticholinergic related adverse events are dryness of mouth and dysphonia. There have been isolated reports of ocular complications (i.e. mydriasis, increased intraocular pressure, angle closure glaucoma, and eye pain) when aerosolised ipratropium bromide either alone or in combination with adrenergic beta2 agonist, has escaped into the eyes. Ocular side effects, gastrointestinal motility disturbances and urinary retention may occur in rare cases and are reversible."
Salbutamol + Ipratropium (Inhaler),"This inhalation aerosol is a combination of Salbutamol (as Sulphate) and Ipratropium Bromide. It is a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) based environment friendly inhaler. Because it does not contain chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) as propellant which is one of the main reasons of ozone layer depletion.Salbutamol is a short acting beta2-adrenergic bronchodilator and Ipratropium Bromide is an anticholinergic bronchodilator. When used in combination, Ipratropium Bromide prevents the increase in intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which are caused by interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptor on bronchial smooth muscle. This inhalation aerosol is expected to maximize the response of the treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by reducing bronchospasm through two distinctly different mechanisms, anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) and sympathomimetic. Simultaneous administration of an anticholinergic (Ipratropium Bromide) and a beta 2-sympathomimetic (Salbutamol) is designed to benefit the patient by producing a greater bronchodilatory effect than when either drug is utilized alone at its recommended dosage.","Due to presence of Salbutamol, mild tremor and headache have been reported. These usually disappear with continuous treatment. There have been very rare reports of treatments muscle cramp, hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, urticaria, bronchospasm and hypotension. For the presence of Ipratropium Bromide headache, influenza, chest pain, nausea, dyspnea, coughing, pharyngitis, sinusitis are rarely reported."
Salbutamol (Inhaler),"Salbutamol is a selective β2-adrenoceptor agonist. At therapeutic doses, it acts on the β2-adrenoceptors of bronchial smooth muscle, with little or no action on the β1-adrenoceptors of cardiac muscle. Salbutamol provides short-acting (4-6 hours) bronchodilatation with a fast onset (within 5 minutes) in reversible airway obstruction. It also has an anti-inflammatory effect on mast cells causing inhibition of release of bronchoconstrictor mediators including histamine, neutrophil chemotactive factor (NCF) and prostaglandin D2.","Salbutamol is generally well tolerated. Few side effects have been observed during inhalation. There are tremors, anxiety, muscle cramps, headache, palpitation, a compensatory small increase in heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles), tachycardia may occur in some patients. Mouth and throat irritation may occur with inhaled salbutamol"
Salbutamol,"Salbutamol is a synthetic sympathomimetic agent with predominant beta-2 adrenergic activity. Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.","Salbutamol may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses."
Sacubitril + Valsartan,"This tablet contains a neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril, and an angiotensin receptor blocker, valsartan. This tablet inhibits neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase; NEP) via LBQ657, the active metabolite of the prodrug sacubitril, and blocks the angiotensin II type-1 (AT1 ) receptor via valsartan. The cardiovascular and renal effects of this tablet in heart failure patients are attributed to the increased levels of peptides that are degraded by neprilysin, such as natriuretic peptides, by LBQ657, and the simultaneous inhibition of the effects of angiotensin II by valsartan. Valsartan inhibits the effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the AT1 receptor, and also inhibits angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone release.","The most common side effects are Angioedema, Hypotension, Impaired Renal Function, Hyperkalemia, Cough, Dizziness."
S-Amlodipine Besilate (Levamlodipine),"Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine is a 1:1 racemic mixture of levamlodipine and dextro amlodipine, it has been demonstrated that levamlodipine is the pharmacologically active, anti-hypertensive isomer.","Most common adverse reactions to amlodipine is edema which occurred in a dose related manner. Other adverse experiences not dose related but reported with an incidence >1.0% are fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain and somnolence."
Ruxolitinib,"Ruxolitinib, a kinase inhibitor, inhibits Janus Associated Kinases (JAKs) JAK1 and JAK2 which mediate the signaling of a number of cytokines and growth factors that are important for hematopoiesis and immune function. JAK signaling involves recruitment of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) to cytokine receptors, activation and subsequent localization of STATs to the nucleus leading to modulation of gene expression. Myelofibrosis (MF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) known to be associated with dysregulated JAK1 and JAK2 signaling. Oral administration of ruxolitinib prevented splenomegaly, preferentially decreased JAK2V617F mutant cells in the spleen and decreased circulating inflammatory cytokines (eg, TNF-α, IL-6).Absorption: Ruxolitinib is rapidly absorbed after oral Ruxolitinib administration with maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) achieved within 1 to 2 hours post-dose. Oral absorption of ruxolitinib was estimated to be at least 95%. Distribution: The mean volume of distribution of ruxolitinib at steady-state is 72 L in patient with MF and PV in myelofibrosis patients.Half-life: the mean half-life of ruxolitinib & metabolites is approximately 5.8 hours. Elimination half-life: The mean elimination half-life of ruxolitinib is approximately 3 hours AUC: Mean ruxolitinib Cmax and total exposure (AUC) increased proportionally over a single dose range of 5 to 200 mg.The plasma protein binding: 97%, mostly to albumin. Metabolism: Ruxolitinib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9.Excretion: Following a single oral dose of radio labeled ruxolitinib in healthy adult subjects, elimination was predominately through metabolism with 74% of radioactivity excreted in urine and 22% excretion via feces. Unchanged drug accounted for less than 1% of the excreted total radioactivity.","The most common side effects are-

Thrombocytopenia, Anemia and Neutropenia
Risk of Infection, bruising, dizziness, headache
Symptom Exacerbation Following Interruption or Discontinuation of treatment with Ruxolitinib
Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer"
Rupatadine Fumarate,"Rupatadine is a long-acting, non-sedative antagonist of histamine H1-receptors. It also antagonizes the platelet activating factor (PAF). Both histamine and PAF cause broncho constriction which leads to an increase in the vascular permeability and act as a mediator in the inflammatory process. With the dual mode of action, Rupatadine shows better therapeutic effect than an isolated antihistamine. Rupatadine possesses other anti allergic properties such as the inhibition of the degranulation of mast cells induced by immunological and non immunological stimuli and inhibition of the release of cytokines, particularly of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF α) in human mastocytes and monocytes.","Common: Asthenia, dizziness, drowsiness. Uncommon: Appetite increased, arthralgia, back pain, concentration impaired, constipation, cough, diarrhea, dry throat, epistaxis, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, increased risk of infection, irritability, malaise, myalgia, nasal dryness, nausea, oropharyngeal pain, rash, thirst, vomiting, weight increased. Rare: Palpitations, tachycardia."
Roxithromycin,Roxithromycin inhibits protein synthesis by irreversibly binding to the 50s ribosomal subunits thus blocking the transpeptidation or translocation reactions of susceptible organisms resulting in stunted cell growth.,"Roxithromycin is well tolerated by patients of all age groups. Less than 4% of treated patients complain of side effects mainly nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and hypersensitivity rash. Other side effects reported include vomiting, dizziness, headache, pruritus, dyspepsia, flatulence, tinnitus, vertigo and constipation. These are in general minor and do not necessitate withdrawal of therapy."
Roxatidine,"Roxatidine acetate suppresses the effect of histamine on the parietal cells of the stomach (H2-receptor antagonist). This suppressive action is dose-dependent. As a result, the production and secretion, particularly of gastric acid, are reduced. Roxatidine acetate has no antiandrogenic effects and does not influence drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver.The H2 antagonists are competitive inhibitors of histamine at the parietal cell H2 receptor. They suppress the normal secretion of acid by parietal cells and the meal-stimulated secretion of acid. They accomplish this by two mechanisms: histamine released by ECL cells in the stomach is blocked from binding on parietal cell H2 receptors which stimulate acid secretion, and other substances that promote acid secretion (such as gastrin and acetylcholine) have a reduced effect on parietal cells when the H2 receptors are blocked.","Occasional headache, GI disturbances, gynaecomastia, alopecia, blood dyscrasias, pancreatitis, sleep disturbances, restlessness, rarely dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions e.g. rash and itching reported occasionally. Changes in pulse rate and transient impairment of sexual drive. Possible increase in liver enzyme activity. May reduce leucocytes and/or thrombocytes."
Roxadustat,"Roxadustat is an orally bioavailable, hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI), with potential anti-anemic activity. Upon administration, roxadustat binds to and inhibits HIF-PH, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of transcription factors in the HIF family under normal oxygen conditions. This prevents HIF breakdown and promotes HIF activity. Increased HIF activity leads to an increase in endogenous erythropoietin production, thereby enhancing erythropoiesis. It also reduces the expression of the peptide hormone hepcidin, improves iron availability, and boosts hemoglobin (Hb) levels. HIF regulates the expression of genes in response to reduced oxygen levels, including genes required for erythropoiesis and iron metabolism. Administration of roxadustat has been shown to induce coordinated erythropoiesis, increasing red blood cell count while maintaining plasma erythropoietin levels within or near normal physiologic range, in multiple subpopulations of CKD patients, including in the presence of infammation, and without a need for supplemental intravenous iron.Roxadustat reversibly binds to and potently inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, reducing HIF-α breakdown and promoting HIF transcriptional activity. Activation of the HIF pathway in this manner results in the induction of target genes involved in erythropoiesis, such as those for EPO, EPO receptor, proteins promoting iron absorption, iron transport and haem synthesis. Roxadustat dose-dependently increased haemoglobin (Hb) levels, signifcantly reduced hepcidin levels and transiently increased endogenous EPO levels within or near physiological range in patients with anemia of CKD who were not dialysis dependent. Roxadustat reduced the dysregulation of iron metabolism associated with CKD by increasing serum transferrin, intestinal iron absorption and the release of stored iron in a dose-dependent manner in patients with anemia associated with dialysis dependent or dialysis-independent CKD. Cholesterol levels were also signifcantly reduced from baseline with roxadustat, regardless of the use of statins or other lipid-lowering agents.","The common adverse reactions associated with roxadustat are hypertension, vascular access thrombosis, diarrhoea, peripheral oedema, hyperkalaemia and nausea."
Rotavirus Vaccine,"Rotavirus is one of the important causes of severe acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children. There are 2 commercially available forms of rotavirus vaccine. Rotavirus is a live, attenuated monovalent vaccine derived from human strain indicated for prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G1, G3, G4 and G9 serotypes; Rotavirus as a live, pentavalent human-bovine reassortant vaccine indicated for prevention of gastreoenteritis caused by rotavirus serotypes G1, G2, G3 and G4. Although presence of porcine cirovirus (PCV1 and PCV2) DNA have been detected in the rotavirus vaccine, current available information shows that there is no evidence that PCV1 or PCV2 poses a safety risk to humans. Exact immunologic mechanism of action is not fully understood although it is known that vaccine viruses replicate in the small intestine and promote active immunity.","In controlled clinical studies, the adverse reaction profile observed in the subjects receiving Rotavirus vaccine was similar to the adverse reaction profile observed in subjects receiving placebo. No increase in the incidence or severity of these reactions was seen with the second dose.However, some adverse reactions considered as being at least possibly related to Rotavirus vaccine vaccination were reported. Very common areirritability, loss of appetite; common arediarrhoea, vomiting, flatulence, abdominal pain, regurgitation of food, fever, fatigue; uncommon are- crying, sleep disorder, somnolence, constipation rare; upper respiratory tract infection hoarseness, rhinorrhoea, dermatitis, rash, muscle cramp; very rare- gastro-enteritis. In a large safety trial, subjects vaccinated with Rotavirus vaccine gave evidence of no increased risk of intussusception when compared with subjects receiving a placebo."
Rosuvastatin,"Rosuvastatin is a selective and competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. Rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways. First, it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL. Second, Rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles.","Rosuvastatin is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events thought to be related to Rosuvastatin were headache, myalgia, constipation, asthenia, abdominal pain and nausea."
Rosiglitazone + Metformin Hydrochloride,"Combination of two antidiabetic agents with different mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: Rosiglitazone maleate, a member of the thiazolidinedione class, and Metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class. Thiazolidinediones are insulin sensitizing agents that act primarily by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization, whereas biguanides act primarily by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production.Rosiglitazone is a highly selective and potent agonist for the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors regulates the transcription of insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose production, transport, and utilization. In addition, PPARγ-responsive genes also participate in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism.The pharmacologic mechanism of action of Metformin is different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, With Metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.","The incidence and types of adverse events reported in clinical trials of Rosiglitazone as monotherapy are upper respiratory tract infection, headache, back pain, hyperglycemia, fatigue, sinusitis, diarrhea, and hypoglycemia. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of the Metformin patients, and that were more common in Metformin- than placebo-treated patients are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, headache."
Ropinirole,"Ropinirole is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist. Ropinirole has the highest affinity at the D3 receptors, which are concentrated in the limbic areas of the brain and may be responsible for some of the neuropsychiatric effects. The exact mechanism of action of ropinirole as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease is unknown, however, it is believed to be related to its ability to selectively stimulate dopamine D2 receptors within the caudate-putamen system in the brain. This system affects body movement. Negligible affinity is seen for ropinirole at α2 adrenoreceptors in the periphery and 5HT-1 receptor. Ropinirole has no affinity at the D1-like receptors, benzodiazepine or GABA receptors. The precise mechanism of action of ropinirole as a treatment for Restless Legs Syndrome is unknown, however, it is believed to be related to its ability to stimulate dopamine receptors.","The most common side effects of Ropinirole include fainting, drowsiness, hallucinations, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, uncontrolled sudden movements, leg swelling, fatigue, confusion, headache, upset stomach, abdominal pain or discomfort, increased sweating etc."
Sildenafil Citrate,"Sildenafil is a selective inhibitor of cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) used for treatment of erectile dysfunction. Danafil (Sildenafil) enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum that results in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum.","The adverse effects treated with Sildenafil are headache, flushing, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, urinary tract infection, abnormal vision, diarrhea, dizziness and rash."
Sevoflurane,"Sevoflurane is a volatile halogenated general anaesthetic that has a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) value ranging from 1.4% to 3.3%. It alters the activity of fast synaptic neurotransmitter receptors like nicotinic acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate. It may depress myocardial contractility and decrease both BP and sympathetic nervous activity. Additionally, it has muscle relaxant properties w/o analgesia.","Cardiorespiratory depression, hypotension, bradycardia; laryngospasm, increased cough and salivation; urinary retention, acute renal failure, changes in liver enzyme values, liver damage; nausea, vomiting, delirium, seizure; rash, urticaria, pruritus, dyspnoea, wheezing, chest discomfort, bronchospasm, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction; agitation, dystonic movements (childn)."
Sevelamer Hydrochloride,"Sevelamer Hydrochloride is a new treatment for the control of serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis. Elevated serum phosphorus levels or uncontrolled hyperphosphatemia leads to development of secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal bone disease, calcification of vascular and nonvascular tissues, and cardiovascular disease. It is a calcium-free and aluminium-free nonabsorbed polymer phosphate binder, it does not cause calcium and aluminium toxicity. When taken with meals it inhibits intestinal absorption of ingested phosphate.","Sevelamer may cause dyspepsia, peritonitis, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, pruritus, abdominal distension, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, arthralgia and less commonly ileus, bowel obstruction and bowel perforation."
Sertraline Hydrochloride,"Sertraline has potent and selective inhibitory action on CNS neuronal reuptake of 5-HT resulting in increased 5-HT concentrations at the synaptic clefts, leading to facilitation of its sustained activity at the postsynaptic receptor sites. It ultimately results in an improvement of depression. Reduction of Serotonin turnover in brain by Sertraline is also another contributing fact implicated in its action. Its prolonged elimination half-life offers a benefit of once daily administration.","Sertraline may cause side effects like upset stomach, diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, loss of appetite, weight changes, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, pain, burning or tingling in the hands or feet, excitement, sore throat etc."
Sertaconazole Nitrate,"Sertaconazole, an imidazole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. Ergosterol is the key component of fungal cell membranes and lack of this component leads to fungal cell injury by leakage of key constituents in the cytoplasm from the cell.","Most common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials are contact dermatitis, dry skin, burning skin, application site skin tenderness."
Sennosides,"Senna glycoside, also known as sennoside or senna, is a medication used to treat constipation and empty the large intestine before surgery. The medication is taken by mouth or via the rectum. It typically begins working in minutes when given by rectum and within twelve hours when given by mouth. It is a weaker laxative than bisacodyl or castor oil.Sennosides A and B increase intestinal motility through release of active anthraquinones into the colon by colonic bacteria. Purified sennosides (sennosides A and B) are used similarly to senna.","Mild abdominal discomfort e.g. colic and cramps; diarrhoea, hypokalaemia and atonic non-functioning colon (prolonged use); reversible melanosis coli (chronic use). May colour the urine yellowish-brown at acidic pH or red at alkaline pH."
Semaglutide (Tablet),"Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with 94% sequence homology to human GLP-1. Semaglutide acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist that selectively binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, the target for native GLP-1. GLP-1 is a physiological hormone that has multiple actions on glucose, mediated by the GLP-1 receptors. The principal mechanism of protraction resulting in the long half-life of semaglutide is albumin binding, which results in decreased renal clearance and protection from metabolic degradation. Furthermore, semaglutide is stabilized against degradation by the DPP-4 enzyme. Semaglutide reduces blood glucose through a mechanism where it stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, both in a glucose-dependent manner. Thus, when blood glucose is high, insulin secretion is stimulated and glucagon secretion is inhibited. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying in the early postprandial phase.","The most common adverse reactions, reported in ≥5% of patients treated with Semaglutide are: nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, decreased appetite, vomiting and constipation."
Semaglutide (Injection),"Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with 94% sequence homology to human GLP-1.

Selexipag,"Selexipag is a selective non-prostanoid IP prostacyclin receptor agonist. Selexipag is a pale yellow crystalline powder that is practically insoluble in water. In the solid-state selexipag is very stable, is not hygroscopic, and is not light sensitive. Selexipag is an oral prostacyclin receptor (IP receptor) agonist that is structurally distinct from prostacyclin. Selexipag is hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase 1 to yield its active metabolite, which is approximately 37-fold as potent as selexipag. Selexipag and the active metabolite are selective for the IP receptor versus other prostanoid receptors (EP1-4, DP, FP, and TP).","The most common side-effects of selexipag are Nausea, Diarrhoea, Vomiting, Headache, Jaw pain, muscle pain, low appetite and low RBC count."
Secukinumab,"Secukinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets IL-17A cytokine to downregulate inflammation in psoriasis, an autoimmune dermatological disease. The pathophysiology of psoriasis has not been fully established, however it is known that dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses plays part in the chronic inflammation associated with the disease. IL-17 represents is a six-membered family (IL-17A to F) of pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokines, expression of which is found to be elevated in psoriatic skin. These cytokines act on many different cell types and provide defense against different extracellular pathogens causing fungal or bacterial infections. IL-17 cytokines are produced by many cells involved in immune system defense, such as Th17, mast cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells - all implicated in promoting inflammation. There is evidence linking IL-17 to pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and even atherosclerosis.","Most common adverse reactions (greater than 1%) are nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, and upper respiratory tract infection."
Secnidazole,"Secnidazole is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. The maximum serum level is obtained after 3 hours following oral administration of 2 gm Secnidazole. The plasma elimination half-life is about 20 hours. The majority of Secnidazole is eliminated via urine (50% of the ingested dose is excreted within 120 hours). The pharmacokinetic profile of Secnidazole gives it the longest half-life of second-generation nitroimidazoles, ensuring 72-hour therapeutic blood levels from a 2 gm single dose.","The clinical studies have shown that Secnidazole is characterized by very good tolerance and no serious adverse reactions have been reported to date. The following side-effects may be observed with Secnidazole as with all nitroimidazole derivatives & are rarely serious:

Most frequent side-effects: Gastrointestinal disturbances, nausea, epigastric pain, metallic taste, glossitis, stomatitis.
Occasional side effects: Urticaria, moderate leukopenia which is reversible on treatment discontinuation.
Rare side-effects: Vertigo, ataxia and motor incoordination, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy. With Secnidazole, gastrointestinal disorders e.g. nausea, vomiting, eoigastric pain, etc., have been reported in very rare cases."
Saxagliptin,Saxagliptin inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme resulting in prolonged active incretin levels. It elevates the circulating levels of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) which stimulates insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells in a glucose dependent manner. It improves glycaemic control by reducing fasting and postprandial plasma glucose concentration in patients w/ type 2 DM.,"The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information: Pancreatitis, Heart Failure, Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Sulfonylurea or Insulin, Hypersensitivity Reactions, Severe and disabling arthralgia, Bullous pemphigoid"
Saquinavir Mesylate,"Saquinavir is a protease inhibitor with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Saquinavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs. Saquinavir inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme which prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein, resulting in noninfectious, immature viral particles.","The most common adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, pneumonia, lipodystrophy and abdominal pain"
Salsalate,"The mode of anti-inflammatory action of salsalate and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not fully defined, but appears to be primarily associated with inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. This inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is done through the inactivation of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2, which are reponsible for catalyzing the formation of prostaglandins in the arachidonic acid pathway. Although salicylic acid (the primary metabolite of salsalate) is a weak inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro, salsalate appears to selectively inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in vivo, providing anti-inflammatory activity equivalent to aspirin and indomethacin. Unlike aspirin, salsalate does not inhibit platelet aggregation.","GI symptoms, hypersensitivity reactions, skin eruptions, angioedema, weakness, rhinitis and dyspnoea, hypoprothrombinaemia. Hepatotoxicity, renal impairment, iron-deficiency anaemia, occult bleeding. Local irritation (rectally); Reye's syndrome."
Salmon Calcitonin,"Calcitonin is a polypeptide hormone produced by the ultimobranchial gland in non-mammalian vertebrates or by the mammalian thyroid parafollicular cells. It inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption and reduces bone turnover. It decreases tubular reabsorption and promotes renal excretion of Ca, Cl, Na, Mg, K and phosphate.","GI disturbances, dizziness, flushing, tingling of the hands, unpleasant taste, skin rash, abdominal pain, urinary frequency, tremor, inj site inflammation. Rarely, diabetogenic effect."
Salmeterol Xinafoate,"Salmeterol stimulates intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of ATP to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) resulting in relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from mast cells.","Dose related tremor, subjective palpitations and headaches are usually mild and transient. Skin reactions, muscle cramps, non-specific chest pain, local irritation and arthralgia have been reported."
Sodium Dichloroisocyanurate,Sodium Dichloroisocyanurate is a disinfectant with the general properties of Chlorine and Sodium hypochlorite. It contains about 65% of available chlorine. It rapidly dissolves into water to kill micro-organisms.,"Skin contact: There may be irritation and redness at the site of contact. Repeated or prolonged contact may cause dermatitis.Eye contact: There may be severe pain, redness and irritation.Ingestion: There may be nausea and vomiting, occasionally with abdominal pain.Inhalation: Mild poisoning causes cough, irritation of the throat and shortness of breath. Very toxic to aquatic organisms, may cause long term adverse effects in the aquatic environment."
Sodium Cromoglicate + Xylometazoline Hydrochloride,"Xylometazoline Hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic agent with alpha-adrenergic activity. It produces vasoconstriction thus reducing nasal congestion. This enables patients suffering from colds to breathe more easily through the nose.Sodium Cromoglicate usually acts through a local effect on the nasal mucosa. It prevents release of the mediators of type-l allergic reactions, including histamine and slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) from sensitized mast cells after the antigen-antibody union has taken place. The drug does not inhibit the binding of IgE and the specific antigen; instead it suppresses the release of substances (e.g., histamine, SRS-A) in response to this reaction. The drug also inhibits Type-III (late allergic, Arthers) reactions to a lesser extent.","No serious side effects have been reported. Occasional irritation of the nasal mucosa may occur during the first day of use. In rare cases with Sodium Cromoglicate solutions alone wheezing and tightness of the chest has been reported. Because a lower dose of Xylometazoline is employed in this preparation it causes mild side effects such as nasal irritation, dryness of the nose, sneezing, headache, insomnia, drowsiness and palpitations."
Sodium Cromoglicate [4%],Sodium Cromoglicate inhibits the degranulation of sensitized mast cells which occurs after exposure to specific antigens. Sodium Cromoglicate acts by inhibiting the release of histamine and various membrane derived mediators of inflammation from mast cells. Sodium Cromoglicate has no vasoconstrictor or antihistaminic activity.,Transient stinging and burning may occur after instillation of this drops. Other symptoms of local irritation have been reported rarely.
Sodium Cromoglicate [2%],"Sodium Cromoglycate 2% sterile Eye Drops inhibits the release of chemical mediators from sensitised mast cells and is capable of rapid phosphorylation of mast cell protein. The exact mechanism of action of the drug remains to be elucidated but Sodium Cromoglycate appears to modulate the allergic response to antigen antibody interactions in a way which prevents the subsequent formation or release of toxic or inflammatory mediators. Sodium Cromoglycate 2% Eye Drops appears to act mainly through a local effect on the mucous of the eye. Approximately 0.03% of an ophthalmic dose of Sodium Cromoglycate 2% Eye Drops is absorbed systemically. Sodium Cromoglycate 2% Eye Drops prevent, release of mediators of type-I allergic reactions, including histamine and slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) from sensitised mast cells after the antigen antibody union has taken place. The drug does not inhibit the binding of IgE to mast cells nor the interaction between cell bound IgE and the specific antigen; instead Sodium Cromoglycate suppresses the release of substances (e.g. histamine, SRS-A) in response to this reaction. The drug also inhibits Type-III (late allergic, Arthus) reactions.",The most frequent adverse effect reported with use of Sodium Cromoglycate 2% Eye Drops is transient ocular stinging or burning upon instillation of the drug.
Sodium Chloride (Tablet),"Sodium chloride is the principle salt involved in maintaining the osmotic tension of blood and tissues, changes in osmotic tension influence the movement of fluids and diffusion of salts in cellular tissue. Sodium Chloride tablet provides a source of sodium where a deficiency exists. Sodium chloride is readily absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract. It is present in all body fluids but specially in the extracellular fluid. The amount of sodium lost (as sweat) is normally small. Osmotic balance is maintained by excretion of surplus amounts in the urine.",No side effects have been reported with Sodium Chloride 300 mg tablet at the recommended dosage.
Sodium Chloride (Ophthalmic Solution),5% Sodium chloride ophthalmic solution is a hypertonic preparation. It is used to reduce the edema or swelling of the cornea. This solution exerts its effect through using the tonicity difference.,"Vision may be temporarily blurred or unstable for a period after applying the drops. Use caution if driving or performing duties requiring clear vision. Burning or irritation of the eye may occur when first applied. If these symptoms continue or become worse, inform your doctor. Notify your doctor immediately if you develop: redness, pain, swelling in or around the eyes, vision problems, sensitivity to light, headache. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist."
Sodium Chloride (Nasal preparation),"Sodium Chloride nasal wash is a non-drug, isotonic saline solution that is used to moisturize nasal membranes. This formulation provides comfort for extensive and continuous use.Sodium Chloride 0.9% nasal wash moistures inside the nose by dissolving and softening thick or crusty mucus thus helps to remove the mucus from the nose and makes breathing easier. Excess sodium is predominantly excreted by the kidneys with small amounts lost in faeces and sweat.","No side effects are expected to occur. However stinging, sneezing, increased nasal discharge, or salty taste may occur in some cases."
Sodium Bicarbonate,"Sodium bicarbonate is a systemic alkalinizing agent. It increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, and raises blood pH, thereby reversing the clinical manifestations of acidosis. It can also be used to replenish electrolyte imbalance as a treatment adjunct for severe diarrhea where the loss of bicarbonate can be significant.","This medication is generally well tolerated. However, high doses may cause headache, nausea or irritability. If any of these effects continue or become bothersome, inform your doctor. Notify your doctor if you develop: muscle weakness, slow reflexes, confusion, swelling of the feet or ankles, black tar-like stools, coffee-ground vomit. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist."
Sodium Alginate + Sodium Bicarbonate + Calcium Carbonate,"The mode of action of the product is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. On ingestion, the product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic acid gel having a near-neutral pH and which floats on the stomach contents quickly and effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours. In severe cases, the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus in preference to the stomach contents and exert a demulcent effect.","In addition to the desired effect of the drug, some side effects may appear such as: constipation, flatulence, stomach cramp or belching. In these cases consult a physician. If too big dose has been taken, there might appear a sensation of swelling. In this case, it is advisable to consult a physician."
Sodium Alginate + Potassium Bicarbonate,This is the combination of Sodium Alginate and Potassium Bicarbonate. Sodium Alginate is a naturally occurring substance. It reacts with the acid in the stomach to form a gel. Potassium Bicarbonate also reacts with the acid in the stomach to form bubbles of carbon dioxide. These bubbles are trapped by the gel formed by Sodium Alginate and they allow the gel to float like a raft on top of the stomach contents. The raft prevents acid in the stomach from flowing back into the esophagus. This relieves the symptoms of reflux such as heartburn. The mode of action of this is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The raft lasts for up to 4 hours on top of the stomach contents and is then broken down in the digestive system and excreted in the feces.,"In addition to the desired effect of the drug, some side effects may appear such as: nausea, constipation, diarrhea or headache. In these cases consult a physician In case too big dosage has been taken, there might appear a sensation of swelling. In this case it is advisable to consult a physician."
Snake Venom Antiserum,Snake venom antiserum is a sterile preparation containing antitoxin globulins and their derivatives. It is the only specific treatment for venomous snake bites.,"Snake venom antiserum being derived from equines is heterologous to human can give either early or late reaction. Adrenaline should be always kept handy, before starting the dose of Snake venom antiserum. Reduction in adverse reactions has been reported by use of adequate dilution of Snake venom antiserum with saline and controlling rate of infusion."
Sitagliptin + Metformin Hydrochloride,"This tablet combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and Metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated then GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. The pharmacologic mechanism of action of Metformin HCl is different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin HCl decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.","The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of patients simultaneously started on sitagliptin and metformin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache.Adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of patients treated with sitagliptin in combination with sulfonylurea and metformin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo in combination with sulfonylurea and metformin were hypoglycemia and headache.Hypoglycemia was the only adverse reaction reported in ≥5% of patients treated with sitagliptin in combination with insulin and metformin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo in combination with insulin and metformin.Nasopharyngitis was the only adverse reaction reported in ≥5% of patients treated with sitagliptin monotherapy and more commonly than in patients given placebo.The most common (>5%) adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin therapy are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, fatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache."
Sitagliptin,"Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by Sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses.","The most common adverse reactions include headache, upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. Hypoglycemia may occur in patients treated with the combination to Sitagliptin and sulfonylurea and add on to insulin."
Simvastatin,"Simvastatin is a preparation of Simvastatin which acts as a Cholesterol lowering agent. The main mechanism of reduction of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is that following inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity, the LDL receptor density on the liver cells is increased and this leads to an increased removal of LDL cholesterol from the plasma and increased catabolism of LDL cholesterol. In addition, there is a reduction in the very low- density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and reduced formation of LDL from VLDL. Simvastatin is extensively metabolised in the liver; which is also the main site of action of the drug.","Simvastatin is generally well tolerated. Headache, fatigue, insomnia, gastrointestinal effects like nausea, constipation or diarrhoea, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal cramps and muscular effects like myalgia, myositis and myopathy have been reported. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been associated with Simvastatin therapy. Hepatitis, pancreatitis, rash, Angio-oedema have also been reported. No potentially life threatening effects have been reported."
Simethicone,"Simethicone is used as an antiflatulent to relieve symptoms commonly referred to gas including upper GI bloating, pressure, fullness or stuffed feeling. The clinical use of Simeticone is based on its antifoaming properties. Its antifoaming action relieves flatulence by dispersing and preventing the formation of mucous surrounded gas pockets in the GI tract. Simeticone acts in the stomach and intestines to change the surface tension of gas bubbles, enabling them to coalesce; thus gas is freed and eliminated more easily by belching or passing flatus. Simeticone aids in the elimination of gas from the GI tract and can be used to reduce postoperative gas pains. Simeticone can also be used prior to gastroscopy to enhance visualization and prior to radiography of the intestine to reduce gas shadows.",Simethicone is physiologically inert and no adverse effect has been noted after oral ingestion.
Silver Sulfadiazine,"The mechanism of Silver Sulfadiazine's antibacterial action has not been fully elucidated. After exposure to the drug, structural changes in the bacterial cell membrane occur, including distortion and enlargement of the cell and a weakening of the cell wall membrane. This is accompanied by reduced viability in sensitive strains. The silver sulfadiazine molecule dissociates and the silver moiety is bound to the bacterial cells. It is believed that, after penetrating the cell wall, the silver moiety is attached to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and prevents bacterial cell proliferation. There is approximately 100 times more DNA in mammalian cells than in bacterial cells. It is thought that the ratio of silver sulfadiazine to bacterial DNA is sufficiently high to prevent bacterial division but the corresponding ratio to epithelial DNA is low enough not to block epithelial cell regeneration. The sulfadiazine moiety also provides a bacteriostatic action against sensitive organisms. In adults, up to 10% of the sulfadiazine may be absorbed and 60 to 85% of the absorbed amount is excreted in the urine. In children with 13% body surface area burns, the urinary sulfadiazine concentration was 31.8 mg/L.","Several cases of transient leukopenia have been reported in-patients receiving Silver Sulfadiazine therapy. Other infrequently occurring events include skin necrosis, erythema multiform, skin discoloration, burning sensation, rashes, and interstitial nephritis."
Silodosin,"Silodosin is a selective antagonist of post-synaptic alpha-1 adrenoreceptors, which are located in the human prostate, bladder base, bladder neck, prostatic capsule and prostatic urethra. Blockade of these alpha-1 adrenoreceptors can cause smooth muscle in these tissues to relax, resulting in an improvement in urine flow and a reduction in BPH symptoms.","Most common adverse reactions are retrograde ejaculation, dizziness, diarrhea, orthostatic hypotension, headache, nasopharyngitis and nasal congestion."
Somatostatin,"Somatostatin is a synthetic cyclic 14 amino-acid peptide, which is identical in structure and action to natural somatostatin. By intravenous infusion in humans, somatostatin causes inhibition of growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, insulin and glucagon secretion as well as inhibition of gastric acid secretion. It also affects the absorption, motility, splanchnic blood flow and trophic functions of the gastro-intestinal tract. Physiologically, somatostatin is found mainly in the gastro-intestinal tract and in the hypothalamus.Somatostatin inhibits the release of gastrin, gastric acid, and pepsin which supports its indication in the treatment of upper gastro-intestinal haemorrhage. Furthermore, somatostatin is capable of reducing remarkably splanchnic blood flow without causing significant variations in the systemic arterial pressure, which proves to be valuable for the management of oesophageal variceal haemorrhage. Somatostatin reduces both pancreatic endocrine and exocrine secretion which makes it effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of postoperative complications of pancreatic surgery. The positive effect of somatostatin in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis can be ascribed to its suppression activity of glucagon secretion.","Nausea, vertigo, and flushing have been reported rarely. Nausea and vomiting have been reported when the infusion rate is greater than 50 µg/min."
Solifenacin Succinate,"Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. It has the highest affinity for M3, M1, and M2 muscarinic receptors. 80% of the muscarinic receptors in the bladder are M2, while 20% are M3. Solifenacin's antagonism of the M3 receptor prevents contraction of the detrusor muscle, while antagonism of the M2 receptor may prevent contraction of smooth muscle in the bladder.","Due to the pharmacological effect of Solifenacin, it may cause anticholinergic undesirable effects of (in general) mild or moderate severity. The frequency of anticholinergic undesirable effects is dose related. The most commonly reported adverse reactionwith Solifenacin is dry mouth. It occurred in 11% of patients treated with 5 mg once daily, in 22% of patients treated with 10 mg once daily and in 4% of placebo-treated patients. The severity of dry mouth was generally mild and only occasionally led to discontinuation of treatment. In general,medicinal product compliance was very high (approximately 99%) and approximately 90% of the patients treated with Solifenacin completed the full study period of 12 weeks treatment.

Gastrointestinal disorders: very common- dry mouth, common-constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, uncommon- gastroesophageal reflux diseases, dry throat, rare- colonic obstruction, faecal impaction, very rare- vomiting.

Sofosbuvir + Velpatasvir,It is a fixed-dose combination tablet containing sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for oral administration. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide analog HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor and velpatasvir is an NS5A inhibitor.,The most common side effects of Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir combination include headache and tiredness. Treatment may result in slowing of the heart rate along with other symptoms when taken with amiodarone (a medicine used to treat certain heart problems).
Sofosbuvir,"Sofosbuvir is nucleotide analog inhibitor, which specifically inhibits HCV NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Following intracellular metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analog triphosphate (GS-461203), sofosbuvir incorporates into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. More specifically, Sofosbuvir prevents HCV viral replication by binding to the two Mg2+ ions present in HCV NS5B polymerase's GDD active site motif and preventing further replication of HCV genetic material","The most common adverse events (incidence greater than or equal to 20%, all grades) observed with Sofosbuvir in combination with Ribavirin were fatigue and headache. The most common adverse events observed with Sofosbuvir in combination with Peginterferon alfa and Ribavirin were fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia, anemia, pruritus, asthenia, rash, decreased appetite, chills, influenza like illness, pyrexia, diarrhea, neutropenia, myalgia, irritability."
Sodium Valproate,"Sodium Valproate, the active ingredient of this preparation is endowed with anti-epileptic activity against a variety of seizures. The mechanism by which Sodium Valproate exerts its anti-epileptic effects has not been established. However, it has been suggested that its activity is related to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).","The most common side effects are anorexia, nausea and vomiting. However, these side effects are minimized with the use of enteric coated tablets. Effects on the CNS include sedation, ataxia and tremor. These symptoms occur infrequently and usually respond to a decrease in doses. Rash, alopecia and stimulation of appetite have been observed occasionally. Sodium Vaiproate has several effects on hepatic function of which elevation of liver enzymes in plasma is observed in up to 40% of patients and often occurs asymptomatically during the first few months of therapy. Rarely a fulminate hepatitis that may be fatal may develop. Children below 2 years of age with other medical conditions and those being treated with multiple antiepileptic agents are specially prone to suffer from hepatic injury, acute pancreatitis and hyperammonemia have also been frequently associated with the use of Sodium Valproate."
Sodium Thiosulfate,"Sodium thiosulfate acts as an antidote in the treatment of cyanide poisoning. It acts as a sulphur-donating substrate for the enzyme rhodanese, thus speeding up the conversion of cyanide to thiocyanide, which is relatively non toxic. It is often used in combination with sodium nitrite but may be used alone in less severe poisoning.",Osmotic disturbances. Oral: catharsis (at high doses).
Sodium Succinate + Cytochrome C + Adenosine + Nicotinamide,"Anhydrous Sodium Succinate (intermediate substance) promotes the production of ATPCytochrome C is involved in the oxidative phosphorylation for synthesizing ATP from ADP.Adenosine plays essential role in producing energy required for the vital function of the life lens e.g. the biosynthesis of glutathione, intermembrane active transport of ions and amino acid, the synthesis of DNA, RNA and nucleic acids.Nicotinamide is said to be involved in the process of creating ATP. NADPH plays a major role in protecting cell against oxidizing agents and from free radicals by maintaining glutathione in its reduced form.","Like any active ingredient, this drug may cause more or less discomfort in some patients."
Sodium Stibogluconate,"The mode of action of sodium stibogluconate is not clearly understood. In vitro exposure of amastigotes to 500 mg pentavalent antimony/ml results in a greater than 50% decrease in parasite DNA, RNA protein and purine nucleoside triphosphate levels. It has been postulated that the reduction in ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and GTP (guanosine triphosphate) synthesis contributes to decreased macromolecular synthesis.","Sodium stibogluconate is exceedingly toxic to veins. One of the practical problems is that after a few doses it can become exceedingly difficult to find a vein in which to inject the drug. The insertion of a PICC does not prevent the problem and can instead exacerbate it: the entire vein along the course of the PICC line can become inflamed and thrombose. Large doses of sodium stibogluconate are often administered as dilute solutions.Pancreatitis is a common deleterious effect of the drug, and the serum amylase or lipase should be monitored twice weekly; there is no need to stop treatment if the amylase remains less than four times the upper limit of normal; if the amylase rises above the cut-off, then treatment should be interrupted until the amylase falls to less than twice the upper limit of normal, whereupon treatment can be resumed. Cardiac conduction disturbances are less common, but ECG monitoring while the medicine is injected is advisable and changes quickly reverse after the drug is stopped or the infusion rate is decreased.The drug can be given intramuscularly but is exceedingly painful when given by this route. It can also be given intralesionally when treating cutaneous leishmaniasis (i.e., injected directly into the area of infected skin) and again, this is exceedingly painful and does not give results superior to intravenous administration.Sodium stibogluconate can also cause a reduced appetite, metallic taste in mouth, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, tiredness, joint pains, muscle aches, dizziness, and anaphylaxis."
Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate,"Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate is a non-absorbed, cation exchange polymer that contains a sodium counterion. Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate increases fecal potassium excretion through binding of potassium in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. Binding of potassium reduces the concentration of free potassium in the gastrointestinal lumen, resulting in a reduction of serum potassium levels. The practical exchange ratio is 1 mEq K per 1 gram of resin.As the resin passes along the intestine or is retained in the colon after administration by enema, the sodium ions are partially released and are replaced by potassium ions. This action occurs primarily in the large intestine, which excretes potassium ions to a greater degree than does the small intestine. The efficiency of this process is limited and unpredictably variable.","The drug may cause some degree of gastric irritation. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and constipation may occur especially if high doses are given. Also, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and significant sodium retention, and their related clinical manifestations, may occur. Occasionally diarrhea develops. Large doses in elderly individuals may cause fecal impaction. Rare instances of colonic necrosis have been reported. Intestinal obstruction due to concretions of aluminum hydroxide, when used in combination with such resin has been reported."
Sodium Picosulfate,"Sodium Picosulfate is a triarylmethane group derivative stimulant laxative. After oral administration it is activated by the colonic bacteria and acts locally in the colon. The active form then stimulates the nerve endings of the intestinal wall and results in colonic peristalsis with promotion of accumulation of water and electrolytes in the colonic lumen. This results in stimulation of defecation, reduction of transit time and softening of the stool. Stimulation of the rectum causes increased motility and a feeling of rectal fullness. The rectal effect may help to restore the ""call to stool"".","Hypersensitivity, dizziness, syncope, vasovagal response, gastrointestinal disorders, diarrhea, abdominal pain and abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting."
Sodium Nitroprusside Dihydrate,"Nitroprusside a powerful vasodilator relaxes the vascular smooth muscle and produce consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins. Other smooth muscle (e.g., uterus, duodenum) is not affected. Sodium nitroprusside is more active on veins than on arteries.One molecule of sodium nitroprusside is metabolized by combination with hemoglobin to produce one molecule of cyanmethemoglobin and four CN- ions; methemoglobin, obtained from hemoglobin, can sequester cyanide as cyanmethemoglobin; thiosulfate reacts with cyanide to produce thiocyanate; thiocyanate is eliminated in the urine; cyanide not otherwise removed binds to cytochromes. Cyanide ion is normally found in serum; it is derived from dietary substrates and from tobacco smoke. Cyanide binds avidly (but reversibly) to ferric ion (Fe+++), most body stores of which are found in erythrocyte methemoglobin (metHgb) and in mitochondrial cytochromes. When CN is infused or generated within the bloodstream, essentially all of it is bound to methemoglobin until intraerythrocytic methemoglobin has been saturated. Once activated to NO, it activates guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle and increases intracellular production of cGMP. cGMP stimulates calcium movement from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum and reduces calcium available to bind with calmodulin. This eventually leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vessel dilatation.","Bradyarrhythmia, hypotension, palpitations, tachyarrhythmia Apprehension, restlessness, confusion, dizziness, headache, somnolence Rash, sweating, Thyroid suppression, Injection site irritation, Muscle twitch, oliguria, renal azotemia, Cardiac dysrhythmia, hemorrhage, decreased platelet aggregation, excessive hypotensive response, Raised intracranial pressure, Metabolic acidosis, Bowel obstruction, Methemoglobinemia, Cyanide poisoning, Thiocyanate toxicity"
Sodium Hyaluronate + Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium,"This eye drops have a unique formula that blends several ocular lubricants (Sodium Hyaluronate and Carboxymethylcellulose) to lubricate, protect and restore eye surface integrity. Sodium Hyaluronate is a natural polymer with viscoelastic property that promotes healing and guards against dehydration on the eye surface. Carboxymethylcellulose is one of the strongest mucoadhesive polymers, which retains direct contact with corneal epithelial cells to provide long-lasting clinical benefits.","The chance of side effect is highly unlikely. However, transient blurring of vision may occur."
Sodium Hyaluronate (Ophthalmic),Sodium hyaluronate is a polysaccharide which functions as a tissue lubricant. It is widely used in ophthalmic surgery because it forms a viscoelastic solution in water which makes it a suitable substitute for aqueous and vitreous humour.,"Transient burning sensation, temporarily blurred vision and transient rise in intraocular pressure. Precautions: To avoid contamination, the tip of the container should not touch any surface and should be fully closed between applications."
Sodium Hyaluronate (Injection),Sodium hyaluronate is a polysaccharide which functions as a tissue lubricant. It is widely used in ophthalmic surgery because it forms a viscoelastic solution in water which makes it a suitable substitute for aqueous and vitreous humour.,"The common side-effects include gastrointestinal complaints, injection site pain, knee swelling/effusion, local skin reactions (rash, ecchymosis), pruritus, and headache."
Sodium Fusidate (Topical),"Sodium Fusidate, an antibiotic derived from Fusidium coccineum, exerts powerful activity against a number of gram-positive organisms. Staphylococci, including the strains resistant to penicillin or other antibiotics, are particularly susceptible to Sodium Fusidate. The therapeutic efficacy of topically applied Sodium Fusidate is due partly to the pronounced antibacterial activity of Sodium Fusidate against the organisms responsible for skin infection and partly to the unique ability of this antibiotic to penetrate intact skin.Fusidic Acid is an anti-microbial agent that acts as an inhibitor of protein synthesis in the microorganism. It interferes with the translocation step by stabilizing the ribosome-guanosine dephosphate elongation factor G-complex. This prevents binding of aminoacyl t-RNA to the ribosome and thereafter stops transfer of additional amino acids to the growing polypeptide.","Sodium Fusidate Ointment is remarkably well tolerated, and there is an extremely low frequency of hypersensitivity reactions."
Sodium Fusidate (Oral),Fusidic acid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interfering with amino acid transfer from aminoacyl-tRNA to protein on the ribosomes.,"GI disturbances eg, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, anorexia; jaundice & change of liver function."
Sodium Fluoride (Mouthwash),Sodium fluoride is a cariostatic agent that is used to prevent dental caries. It can also be used as a source of fluoride in total parenteral nutrition.,"Hypersensitivity reactions, rash, nausea, vomiting. Products containing stannous fluoride may cause teeth staining."
Sodium Dihydrogen Phosphate + Disodium Hydrogen Phosphate,Sodium phosphate can be used in the management of hypophosphataemia. It also acts as a mild osmotic laxative when given orally as dilute solutions or by the rectal route. Phosphate enemas or concentrated oral solutions are used for bowel cleansing before surgery or endoscopy procedures.,"Gastrointestinal side effects of sodium biphosphate and sodium phosphate have included bloating (31% to 41%), nausea (26% to 30%), abdominal pain (23% to 25%), and vomiting (4% to 9%). Nervous system side effects have included dizziness, headache, and seizures. Renal side effects have included renal impairment, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), increased creatinine, acute renal failure, acute phosphate nephropathy, nephrocalcinosis, and renal tubular necrosis. Hypersensitivity reactions reported have included anaphylaxis, rash, pruritus, urticaria, throat tightness, bronchospasm, dyspnea ."
Sulphamethoxazole + Trimethoprim,Cotrimoxazole having broad spectrum bactericidal activity against a wide range of gram-positive & gram-negative bacteria and some protozoa. Co-trimoxazole containing Trimethoprim and Sulphamethoxazole in a 1:5 combination exerts its bactericidal action by the sequential blockade of two bacterial enzyme systems in the biosynthesis of folinic acid in the microorganism.,"The side effects like crystalluria, allergic reactions, haemolysis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis etc. have been reported rarely with Sulphamethoxazole-Trimethoprim combination. Other side effects are less serious in nature such as malaise, headache, nausea and vomiting. These are normally transient and do not require withdrawal of treatment."
Sulphadoxine + Pyrimethamine,"Sulphadoxine & Pyrimethamine is an antimalarial agent embodying the concept of synergism. Individually the components of this preparation exert inferior result with higher doses in comparison with that obtained with the combination. Moreover, this preparation is effective against strains that are resistant to other antimalarial agents and the risk of resistance development is minimum with this preparation. It is extremely long acting drug, attacks the different development stages of the parasite and attains effective concentration with a single dose. The protective effect of a single dose lasts for approximately four weeks and this preparation is compatible with other antimalarial drugs and with antibiotics. It does not influence the action of antidiabetic agents.","Sulphadoxine & Pyrimethamine at the recommended dose is well tolerated. Main side effects are given below 

Skin reactions: Drug rash, pruritus and slight hair loss have been observed.
Gastro-intestinal reactions: Feeling of fullness, nausea, rarely vomiting, stomatitis.
Haematological reactions: In rare cases, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and megaloblastic anemia have been observed.
Other reactions: Fatigue, headache, fever, polyneuritis may occasionally occur."
Sulindac,"Sulindac is a non-steroidal antirheumatic agent possessing anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic properties. Prostaglandin synthetase inhibition is probably the basis of the mechanism of action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Following absorption, Sulindac undergoes two major transformations. It is oxidised to the sulphone and then reversibly reduced to the sulphide. The sulphide metabolite is the biologically active form which is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis.","Gastrointestinal side effects are the most common and consist of abdominal pain, nausea and constipation. Gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding may also occur. The most frequently reported central nervous system side effects are drowsiness, dizziness, headache and nervousness. Other adverse effects include depression, tinnitus, confusion, light-headedness, insomnia, psychiatric disturbances, syncope, convulsions, coma, peripheral neuropathy, blurred vision and other ocular effects, oedema and mass gain, hypertension, hematuria, skin rashes, pruritus, urticaria, stomatitis, alopecia and hypersensitivity reactions. A hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of fever and chills, skin rashes or other cutaneous manifestations, hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity (including renal failure), leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, inflammed glands or lymph nodes, and arthralgia have been reported. Leucopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anaemia, haemolytic anaemia, agranulocytosis, epitaxis, hyperglycaemia, hyperkalaemia and vaginal bleeding have been reported. There have also been reports of hepatitis and jaundice or renal failure."
Sulfinpyrazone,"Sulfinpyrazone increases urinary excretion of uric acid by competitively inhibiting tubular reabsorption of uric acid, thus lowering serum urate concentration and eventually reducing urate deposits in the tissues.","The symptoms are upset stomach, vomiting, loss of appetite and joint pain. If you experience any of the following symptoms like difficulty in breathing, tightness in the chest, skin rash, unusual bleeding, fever, sore throat and mouth sores, call your doctor immediately."
Sulfasalazine,"The mode of action of Sulfasalazine is still under investigation, but may be related to the anti inflammatory and/or immunomodulatory properties that have been observed in animal and in vitro models, to its affinity for connective tissue, and/or to the relatively high concentration it reaches in serous fluids, the liver and intestinal walls, as demonstrated in autoradiographic studies in animals. In ulcerative colitis, clinical studies utilizing rectal administration of Sulfasalazine, Sulfapyridine and 5-Aminosalyclic Acid have indicated that the major therapeutic action may reside in the 5-Aminosalyclic Acid moiety. The relative contribution of the parent drug and the major metabolites in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown.","The common adverse reactions are anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, gastric distress, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dizziness, apparently reversible oligospermia etc."
Sulfacetamide sodium,"The sulfonamides are bacteriostatic agents and the spectrum of activity is similar for all. Sulfonamides inhibit bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by preventing the condensation of the pteridine with aminobenzoic acid through competitive inhibition of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. Resistant strains have altered dihydropteroate synthetase with reduced affinity for sulfonamides or produce increased quantities of aminobenzoic acid.Topically applied sulfonamides are considered active against susceptible strains of the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus (viridans group), Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella species, and Enterobacter species.Topically applied sulfonamides do not provide adequate coverage against Neisseria species, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A significant percentage of staphylococcal isolates are completely resistant to sulfa drugs.","Bacterial and fungal corneal ulcers have developed during treatment with sulfonamide ophthalmic preparations. The most frequently reported reactions are local irritation, stinging and burning. Less commonly reported reactions include non-specific conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, secondary infections and allergic reactions.Fatalities have occurred, although rarely, due to severe reactions to sulfonamides including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias"
Sulconazole Nitrate,"Sulconazole nitrate is an imidazole derivative that inhibits the growth of the common pathogenic dermatophytes including Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Microsporum canis. It also inhibits the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur, and certain gram positive bacteria. A maximization test with sulconazole nitrate solution showed no evidence of irritation or contact sensitization.",There were no systemic effects and only infrequent cutaneous adverse reactions in 370 patients treated with sulconazole nitrate solution in controlled clinical trials. Approximately 1% of these patients reported itching and 1% burning or stinging. These complaints did not usually interfere with treatment.
Sucralose,"Sucralose is a Zero Calorie artificial sweetener. Sucralose is about 600 times sweeter than sugar. Sucralose Obtained from sucrose where three hydroxyl groups are replaced by three chlorine atoms. Because it is made from sugar, sucralose tastes like sugar. Tightly bound Carbon-chlorine bonds are exceptionally stable and prevent Sucralose from being metabolized for energy, making Sucralose calorie free. The chlorine atoms also provide heat stability, enabling sucralose to withstand of cooking and baking without losing sweetness. Sucralose is not broken down for energy in the body. So it has no calorie. The sucralose molecule passes through the body unchanged, is not metabolized and is eliminated after consumption. Sucralose does not cause tooth decay, has no effect on carbohydrate metabolism, no effect on fetal or neonatal development because sucralose is not actively transported across the blood-brain barrier, the placental barrier or the mammary gland. Sucralose is non-interference in the utilization and absorption of glucose, metabolism of carbohydrates and secretion of insulin. Therefore, it is a safe substance able to be ingested by diabetes patients.",No known side effects
Sucralfate,"Sucralfate is non-systemic as the drug is only minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The minute amount which absorbed primarily excretes in the urine. Sucralfate promotes the healing of gastric and duodenal ulcers by the formation of a chemical complex that binds to the ulcer site to establish a protective barrier. Besides, Sucralfate inhibits the action of pepsin and bile.","The most common adverse event was headache (3.4%) followed by nausea (2.3%), abdominal pain (2.3%), constipation (1.1%), diarrhea (1.1%), and urticaria (1.1%). The majority of patients who reported bezoars, had underlying medical conditions that may predispose to bezoar formation (such as delayed gastric emptying) or were receiving concomitant enteral tube feedings. Episodes of hyperglycemia have been reported in diabetic patient."
Strontium Ranelate,Strontium Ranelate works by reducing bone breakdown and stimulating rebuilding of bone and therefore reduces the risk of fracture. The newly formed bone is of normal quality.,"Like all medicines, Strontium can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most common side effects are nausea, diarrhoea, headache and skin irritation. However,these effects were mild and short-lived and usually did not cause the patients to stop taking their treatment. Other events less commonly reported included blood clots, fainting fit, memory troubles and, in rare cases, seizures. If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor."
Streptomycin,"Aminoglycosides like Streptomycin ""irreversibly"" bind to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA. Specifically Streptomycin binds to four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to interference with the initiation complex, misreading of mRNA so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes.","Neurotoxic reactions (e.g. vestibular and cochlear function disturbance, optic nerve dysfunction, peripheral neuritis, arachnoiditis, encephalopathy); paraesthesia of face, rash, fever, angioneurotic oedema, eosinophilia; exfoliative dermatitis, azotemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, muscular weakness, amblyopia."
Streptokinase,Streptokinase forms a complex with plasminogen which then converts plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin breaks down clots as well as fibrinogen and other plasma proteins.,"The following adverse reactions are based on experience from clinical trials and on post marketing experience of Streptokinase. General disorders:

Common: Headache and back pain, muscle pain (including myalgia), chills and/or fever as well as asthenia/malaise.

Haemorrhage and bleeding:

Gastrointestinal disorders:

Common: Nausea, diarrhoea, epigastric pain and vomiting."
Spironolactone,"Spironolactone is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents which act more proximally in the renal tubule. Aldosterone interacts with a cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptor to enhance the expression of the Na+ K+ ATPase and the Na+ channel involved in a Na+ K+ transport in the distal tubule . Spironolactone bind to this mineralcorticoid receptor, blocking the actions of aldosterone on gene expression. Aldosterone is a hormone; its primary function is to retain sodium and excrete potassium in the kidneys.","Gynaecomastia may develop in association with the use of Spironolactone. Other adverse reactions are: GI symptoms including cramping and diarrhoea, drowsiness, lethargy, headache, urticaria, mental confusion, impotence, irregular menses or amenorrhoea and post-menopausal bleeding."
Spiramycin,"The mechanism of action of macrolides has been a matter of controversy for some time. Spiramycin, a 16-membered macrolide, inhibits translocation by binding to bacterial 50S ribosomal subunits with an apparent 1 : 1 stoichiometry. This antibiotic is a potent inhibitor of the binding to the ribosome of both donor and acceptor substrates. The primary mechanism of action is done by stimulation of dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from ribosomes during translocation.","Side effects of include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, inflamed bowels, pruritus (itchy skin), tingling or numbness in the skin."
Spectinomycin,Tinobac Sterile Powder contains Spectinomycin Hydrochloride which is an aminocyclitol antibiotic produced by a species of soil microorganism designated as Streptomyces spectabilis. Spectinomycin Hydrochloride is an inhibitor of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell; the site of action is the 30S ribosomal subunit. In vitro studies have shown Spectinomycin Hydrochloride to be active against most strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae,"The following reactions were observed during the single dose clinical trials: soreness at the injection site, urticaria, dizziness, nausea, chills, fever and insomnia"
Sparfloxacin,"Sparfloxacin is a synthetic, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent from the difluoroquinolone family. It has been reported to be more active in vitro than ciprofloxacin against some organisms, including staphylococci and Mycobacteria, and has a much longer plasma half-life (16 hours).Sparfloxacin inhibits the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase which is an enzyme essential for DNA replication thus promoting the breakage of DNA structures. It has activity against S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and Mycobacterium spp.","Most of the adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. The most frequently reported events among the Sparfloxacin treated patients with the recommended dosage are: diarrhea, nausea, headache, dyspepsia, dizziness, insomnia, abdominal pain and QTc interval prolongation."
Sotalol Hydrochloride,"Sotalol is a non-cardioselective beta-blocker. It increases sinus cycle length, slows heart rate, decreases AV nodal conduction and increases AV nodal refractoriness. It also prolongs AV monophasic action potentials. However, it lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane-stabilising properties.",The most significant adverse effects are those which are typical of its class I and class II (Cardiac action potential duration prolongation) effects.
Sorafenib Tosylate,"Sorafenib is a kinase inhibitor that decreases tumor cell proliferation in vitro. Sorafenib was shown to inhibit multiple intracellular (CRAF, BRAF and mutant BRAF) and cell surface kinases (KIT, FLT-3, RET, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and PDGFR-ß). Several of these kinases are thought to be involved in tumor cell signaling, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Sorafenib inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma, and several other human tumor xenografts in immunocompromised mice.","Rash and hand-foot skin reactions. Hypophosphataemia, hypertension, bleeding, tinnitus, depression and erectile dysfunction. Alopecia, pruritus, dry skin, erythema, acne, flushing, exfoliative dermatitis, hoarseness, GI disturbances, arthralgia, myalgia, asthenia, pain and peripheral neuropathy."
Somatropin,"Somatropin (as well as endogenous GH) binds to a dimeric GH receptor in the cell membrane of target cells resulting in intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects. Some of these pharmacodynamic effects are primarily mediated by IGF-I produced in the liver and also locally (e.g., skeletal growth, protein synthesis), while others are primarily a consequence of the direct effects of somatropin (e.g., lipolysis).","The most common side effects of Somatropin include headaches, muscle pain, joint stiffness, high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), sugar in your urine (glucosuria)."
Tedizolid Phosphate,"After conversion to its active form by phosphatases, tedizolid exerts its antibacterial activity through inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible Gram-positive bacteria. Cross-resistance between other non-oxazolidinone antibacterial drugs is unlikely as it inhibits bacterial protein synthesis through a different mechanism.","The most common adverse reactions (>2%) are nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, and dizziness"
Tea tree oil + Geothermal water (hair & body),"Tea Tree Oil: Tea tree oil comes from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia, a small tree native to Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Tea tree oil contains a number of compounds, including terpinen-4-ol that have been shown to kill certain bacteria, viruses and fungi.Geothermal Water: It is natural hot water and has skin healing benefits.","Topical treatment with Tea Tree Oil (TTO) enriched with geothermal water is generally well tolerated. As with other shampoos, a local burning sensation, itching or contact dermatitis (due to irritation or allergy) may occur on exposed areas. Oily and dry hair have been reported rarely with the use of Tea Tree Oil (TTO) enriched with geothermal water."
Tazarotene,"Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the cognate carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by rapid deesterification in animals and man. In cell culture and in vitro models of skin, tazarotene suppresses expression of MRP8, a marker of inflammation present in the epidermis of psoriasis patients at high levels. In human keratinocyte cultures, it inhibits cornified envelope formation, whose build-up is an element of the psoriatic scale.","The most frequent adverse events reported with Tazarotene cream were limited to the skin. Those occurring in 10 to 23% of patients, in descending order, included pruritus, erythema and burning. For acne treatment, in 10 to 30% patients, it is reported desquamation, dry skin, face pain, irritation and stinging sensation."
Tapentadol Hydrochloride,Tapentadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic. It is 18 times less potent than morphine in terms of binding to human mu-opioid receptors. It also increases norepinephrine concentrations in the brains of rats via inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake. Selective mu-opioid antagonists like naloxone can block analgesia from tapentadol. It also has not effect on the QT interval.Tapendadol causes large increases in levels of extracellular norepinephrine (NE) due to a dual mechanism of action involving mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonism as well as noradrenaline reuptake inhibition.,"The following treatment-emergent adverse events may happen: heart rate increased, heart rate decreased, visual disturbance, abdominal discomfort, impaired gastric emptying, irritability, edema, drug withdrawal syndrome, hypersensitivity, involuntary muscle contractions, sensation of heaviness, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, disturbance in attention, sedation, dysarthria, memory impairment, ataxia, presyncope, syncope, coordination abnormal, seizure, urticaria, blood pressure decreased etc."
Tamsulosin Hydrochloride + Dutasteride,"Tamsulosin & Dutasteride is a combination of two drugs with complementary mechanisms of action to improve symptoms in patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). Tamsulosin Hydrochloride, an antagonist of alpha1A-adrenoreceptors and Dutasteride, a dual 5 alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI). Treatment of BPH with alpha1-adrenoreceptor blocking agents and 5ARIs results in an improvement in urine flow rate and a reduction in symptoms of BPH.Tamsulosin: An alpha1-adrenoreceptor blocking agent that affects the dynamic component of BPH by inhibiting alpha1-adrenoreceptors in the stromal prostatic smooth muscle and bladder neck. Blockade of these adrenoreceptors can cause smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate to relax. Specifically, Tamsulosin exhibits selectivity for both alpha 1A and alpha 1D receptors over the alpha1B-adrenoreceptor subtype. These three adrenoreceptor subtypes have a distinct distribution pattern in human tissue. Whereas approximately 70% of the alpha1-receptors in human prostate are of the alpha 1A subtype, the human bladder contains predominantly the alpha 1D subtype while blood vessels express predominantly alpha 1B subtype. It is further believed that blockade of the alpha 1D subtypes in the human obstructed bladder may be responsible for reducing detrusor overactivity and subsequent relief of storage symptoms.Dutasteride: A synthetic 4-azasteriod compound is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both Type I and Type II 5 alpha-reductase isoenzymes that affects the static component of BPH by inhibiting the conversion of Testosterone to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase. 5 alpha-reductase exists as 2 isoforms, Type I and Type II, both of which are present in the prostate. It has been observed that compared to normal tissue, the expression of both isoenzymes are increased in BPH tissue. Dissociation from this complex has been evaluated under in vitro and in vivo conditions and is extremely slow. Dutasteride lowers DHT levels and leads to a reduction in prostatic volume, thereby treating an underlying cause of BPH. Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor.","The most common adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving combination therapy were impotence, decreased libido, breast disorders (including breast enlargement and tenderness), ejaculation disorders and dizziness. The percentages of subjects with ejaculation disorders, decreased libido and impotence were higher in the combination therapy group compared with either monotherapy groups."
Tamsulosin  Hydrochloride,"Tamsulosin, a selective alpha1 adrenoceptor blocking agent, exhibits its selectivity for alpha1 A adrenoceptors in human prostate. Blockade of these adrenoceptors can cause smooth muscle in the bladder neck and prostate to relax, resulting in an improvement in urine flow rate and a reduction in symptoms of BPH. Absorption of Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule 0.4mg is essentially complete (90%) following oral administration under fasting conditions. The time to maximum concentration (Tmax) is reached by four to five hours under fasting conditions and by six to seven hours when administered with food. Tamsulosin hydrochloride is extremely bound to human plasma protein (94% to 99%). Tamsulosin hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P 450 enzymes in the liver and less than 10% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged form. Following intravenous or oral administration of an immediate-release formulation the elimination half-life of Tamsulosin hydrochloride in plasma ranges from five to seven hours. Because of the absorption rate controlled pharmacokinetics with Prostam capsules, the apparent half-life of Tamsulosin hydrochloride is approximately 9 to 13 hours in healthy volunteers and 14 to 15 hours in the target population.","The following adverse reactions have been reported during the use of Tamsulosin: dizziness, abnormal ejaculation and; less frequently headache, asthenia, postural hypotension and palpitations."
Tamoxifen Citrate,"Tamoxifen is a praparation of Tamoxifen which is a non-steroidal, triphenylene based drug and displays a complex spectrum of oestrogen antagonist and oestrogen agonist like pharmacological effects in different tissues. In breast cancer patients, at the tumour level, Tamoxifen acts primarily as an antioestrogen, preventing oestrogen binding to the oestrogen receptor. Additionally Tamoxifen has been reported to lead to maintenance of bone mineral density in post-menopausal women.","Side effects can be classified as either due to the pharmacological action of the drug, e.g., hot flushes, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, pruritus vulvae and tumour flare or as more general side effects, e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, light-headedness and occasionally fluid retention and alopecia. When such side effects are severe, it may be possible to control them by a simple reduction of dosage (within the recommended dose range) without loss of control of the disease. Skin rashes including isolated reports of erythema multiforme, Stevens Johnson syndrome and bullous pemphigoid and rare hypersensitivity reactions, including angio-oedema have been reported. A small number of patients with bony metastases have developed hypercalcaemia on initiation of therapy.Falls in platelet count, usually only to 80,000-90,000 per/mm3 but occasionally lower, have been reported in patients taking Tamoxifen for breast cancer.A number of cases of visual disturbances including infrequent reports of corneal changes and retinopathy have been described in patients receiving Tamoxifen therapy. An increased incidence of cataracts has been reported in association with the administration of the drug. Uterine fibroids and endometrial changes including hyperplasia and polyps have been reported. Cystic ovarian swellings have occasionally been observed in premenopausal women receiving Tamoxifen.Leucopenia has been observed following the administration of Tamoxifen, sometimes in association with anaemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia has been reported on rare occasions; this can sometimes be severe. There is evidence of an increased incidence of thromboembolic events including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism during Tamoxifen therapy.Tamoxifen has been associated with changes in liver enzyme levels and on rare occasions with a spectrum of more severe liver abnormalities, including fatty liver, cholestasis and hepatitis. Rarely, elevation of serum triglyceride levels, in some cases with pancreatitis, may be associated with the use of Tamoxifen."
Tafluprost,"Tafluprost, a prostaglandin analog is a selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist which is believed to reduce intraocular pressure by increasing uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor.",The most frequently reported treatment-related side effect is ocular hyperemia. Rare side effects observed include eye irritation and blurred vision.
Tadalafil,"Tadalafil is a selective phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor. Inhibition of PDE5 increases cGMP in smooth muscle cells. cGMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, causing penile erection. PDE5 also is present in smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder wall. Inhibiting PDE5 increases cGMP concentrations leading to relaxation of smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder. Smooth muscle relaxation may improve blood flow to the urinary tract and widen the opening of the bladder neck, resulting in improved voiding.","Headache, Dyspepsia, Back pain, Myalgia, Nasal pharyngitis, Nasal congestion are common side effects. Change in Color Vision, Sudden vision loss, Hearing loss, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Exfoliative dermatitis, Angina, Stroke, Myocardial infarction, Severe hypotension, Tachycardia may also occur rarely."
Tacrolimus (Topical),"Tacrolimus is a macroiide immunomodulator produced by fungus, Streptomyces tsukubaensis. It has been demonstrated that Tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation by first binding to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12. A complex of Tacrolimus-FKBP-12, calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited. This leads to a general decrease in the entire inflammatory cascade.","Topically applied Tacrolimus ointment have very few and rare type of side-effects including skin burning, pruritus, flu-like symptoms, allergic reactions, skin erythema, skin infections, headache, etc."
Suxamethonium Chloride,"Suxamethonium is a muscle relaxant. It acts as a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker by imitating the action of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Suxamethonium acts on muscle type nicotinic receptors. Binding of Suxamethonium to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor results in opening of the receptor's nicotinic sodium channel; sodium moves into the cell, a disorganized depolarization of the motor-end plate occurs and calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This results in fasciculation. In the normal muscle, following depolarization, acetylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase and the muscle cell is able to 'reset' ready for the next signal. But Suxamethonium is degraded not by acetylcholinesterase, rather by butyrylcholinesterase, a plasma cholinesterase. This hydrolysis by butyrylcholinesterase is much slower than that of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase. Thus Suxamethonium has a longer duration of effect than acetylcholine and it does not allow the muscle cell to 'reset' and keeps the 'new' resting membrane potential below threshold. When acetylcholine binds to an already depolarized receptor it cannot cause further depolarization. Calcium is removed from the muscle cell cytosol independent of repolarization. As the calcium is taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle relaxes. This explains muscle flaccidity rather than tetany following fasciculation.","Cardiovascular: bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, arrhythmias. Respiratory: bronchospasm, prolonged respiratory depression and apnea. Musculoskeletal: muscle fasciculation, post-operative muscle pains, myoglobinemia. Others: hyperthermia, increased intra-ocular pressure increased intra-gastric pressure, rash, excessive salivation."
Suvorexant,Suvorexant is a highly selective antagonist for orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R. The mechanism by which Suvorexant exerts its therapeutic efect in insomnia is presumed to be through antagonism of orexin receptors. The orexin neuropeptide signaling system is a central promoter of wakefulness. Blocking the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to receptors OX1R and OX2R is thought to suppress wake drive.,"Common side effects are Sleepiness during the day, Not thinking clearly, Act strangely, confused, or upset, Sleep-walking"
Super antioxidant [vitamins & minerals],"Vitamin A is essential for human health. Vitamin A is highly important for vision, cell development and immunity. Vitamin A's role on immunity contributes to its anti-cancer properties.Vitamin C is one of the most widely taken supplements and plays a primary role in the formation of collagen, which is important for the growth and repair of cells, gums, blood vessels, bones and teeth. Thus vitamin C helps in faster recovery after surgery or any other trauma. Vitamin C quenches free radicals in the water based cellular components and thus acts as an antioxidant.Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, which is stored in the liver, adipose tissues, heart, muscles etc. It is an active antioxidant, which prevents oxidation of fat compounds. It works in synergy with Selenium.Vitamin K is a key anti-aging vitamin and it prevents heart disease and osteoporosis.Zinc is an important mineral that can actually rejuvenate the shrinking thymus gland that involves the working of the immune system. Zinc is a co-factor in over 100 enzymes of the body.Selenium: Apart from being a co-factor in antioxidant enzymes, Selenium by itself has potent antioxidant capabilities. So, it prevents aging and hardening of tissues through oxidation. Vitamin E and Selenium are synergistic and seem to potentiate each other's antioxidant activities.Copper is an important co-factor of a number of enzymes present in our body. This enzymes act as endogenous antioxidant systems.Manganese, an antioxidant, is one of the minerals required to form SOD (Super Oxide Dismutase). SOD is an enzyme that protect against cell damaging free radicals.","Generally, this preparation is well-tolerated. Diarrhea may occasionally occur during treatment with beta carotene and the skin may assume a slightly yellow discoloration. The side-effects of vitamin A are reversible. Vitamin C and vitamin E may cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disturbances."
Sunitinib,"Sunitinib inhibits cellular signaling by targeting multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).These include all receptors for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-Rs) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs), which play a role in both tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. The simultaneous inhibition of these targets therefore reduces tumor vascularization and triggers cancer cell apoptosis and thus results in tumor shrinkage.Sunitinib also inhibits CD117 (c-KIT), the receptor tyrosine kinase that (when improperly activated by mutation) drives the majority of gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors. It has been recommended as a second-line therapy for patients whose tumors develop mutations in c-KIT that make them resistant to imatinib, or who the cannot tolerate the drug.In addition, sunitinib binds other receptors. These include: RET, CD114, CD135. The fact that sunitinib targets many different receptors, leads to many of its side effects such as the classic hand-foot syndrome, stomatitis, and other dermatologic toxicities.","Fatigue, GI disorders, skin discoloration, rash, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, dry skin, hair color changes, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, dysguesia, anorexia, HTN, neutropenia."
Sumatriptan,"Sumatriptan Nasal Spray is an aqueous suspension of microfine Sumatriptan BP 10 mg for topical administration to the nasal mucosa by means of a metering, atomizing spray pump. Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5 HT1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5 HT1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.","Common side effects: Unusual or unpleasant taste in the mouth; pain, burning, numbness, or tingling in the nose or throat; runny or stuffy nose after using the nasal medicine.Rare side effects: Anxiety, burning sensation, discomfort of the nasal cavity and throat, general feeling of illness or tiredness & vision changes."
Sulphonated Surfactant,"Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension (or interfacial tension) between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants.A wetting agent is a surfactant that, when dissolved in water, lowers the advancing contact angle, aids in displacing an air phase at the surface, and replaces it with a liquid phase. Examples of application of wetting to pharmacy and medicine include the displacement of air from the surface of sulfur, charcoal, and other powders for the purpose of dispersing these drugs in liquid vehicles; the displacement of air from the matrix of cotton pads and bandages so that medicinal solutions can be absorbed for application to various body areas; the displacement of dirt and debris by the use of detergents in the washing of wounds; and the application of medicinal lotions and sprays to surface of skin and mucous membranes.","Mild irritation, skin sensitization"
Testosterone Undecanoate,"Testosterone plays a key role in male sexual differentiation and is involved in regulation of hematopoiesis, body composition, and bone metabolism. As a result, testosterone replacement therapy in males with hypogonadism can result in improved sexual function, increased lean body mass, bone density, erythropoiesis, prostate size, and changes in lipid profiles.Testosterone is produced by Leydig cells and exerts it's effects by binding to androgen receptors throughout the body. Testosterone affects the voice, genitalia, mood, and influences muscle growth and protein expression. Accordingly, males with low levels of testosterone often experience decreased libido, fatigue, mood changes and dysphoria. Exogenous sources of testosterone are designed to mimic the effects of endogenous testosterone.","In general:

increased sexual desire
fluid retention in the tissues, usually marked by swelling of ankles or feet

In men:

prolonged abnormal, painful erection of the penis
disturbed formation of sperm
decreased amount of sperm with seminal discharge

In elderly men:

problems with passing urine

In young boys:

early sexual development
erections occurring more often than normal
enlarged penis
disturbed growth

Tell your doctor as soon as possible if any side-effect becomes troublesome or continues."
Testosterone Decanoate,"Testosterone is the principal endogenous hormone essential for normal growth and development of the male sex organs and male secondary sex characteristics. During adult life testosterone is essential for the functioning of the testes and accessory structures and for the maintenance of libido, sense of well-being, erectile potency, prostate and seminal vesicle function.Treatment of hypogonadal men with Testanon results in a clinically significant rise of plasma concentrations of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and androstenedione, as well as a decrease of SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin). In males with primary (hypergonadotropic) hypogonadism treatment with Testosterone Decanoate results in a normalization of gonadotropin levels. Treatment of female-to-male transsexuals with Testosterone Decanoate results in a clinically significant rise of plasma testosterone levels, a decrease of LH and FSH levels and a decrease in SHBG level.","The most common side effects of Testosterone therapy are precocious sexual development, increased frequency of erections, phallic enlargement and premature epiphyseal closure, priapism, oligospermia, decreased ejaculatory volume and fluid & sodium retention."
Teriparatide,"Endogenous 84-amino acid parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. Physiological actions of PTH include regulation of bone metabolism, renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, and intestinal calcium absorption. The biological actions of PTH and teriparatide are mediated through binding to specific high-affinity cell-surface receptors. Teriparatide and the 34 N-terminal amino acids of PTH bind to these receptors with the same affinity and have the same physiological actions on bone and kidney. Teriparatide is not expected to accumulate in bone or other tissues. The skeletal effects of teriparatide depend upon the pattern of systemic exposure. Once-daily administration of teriparatide stimulates new bone formation on trabecular and cortical (periosteal and/or endosteal) bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic activity over osteoclastic activity. In monkey studies, teriparatide improved trabecular microarchitecture and increased bone mass and strength by stimulating new bone formation in both cancellous and cortical bone. In humans, the anabolic effects of teriparatide manifest as an increase in skeletal mass, an increase in markers of bone formation and resorption, and an increase in bone strength. By contrast, continuous excess of endogenous PTH, as occurs in hyperparathyroidism, may be detrimental to the skeleton because bone resorption may be stimulated more than bone formation.","Most common adverse reactions include: arthralgia, pain, and nausea."
Terfenadine,"Terfenadine competes with histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. This reversible binding of terfenadine to H1-receptors suppresses the formation of edema, flare, and pruritus resulting from histaminic activity. As the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, CNS depression is minimal.","Anxiety, palpitations, insomnia, mild GI distubances, erythema multiforme and galactorrhoea."
Terconazole,"Terconazole disrupts ergosterol synthesis by binding to fungal cytochrome P450. It is active in vitro against Candida spp. and other fungi. It has some antibacterial activity in vitro but not against usual vag flora e.g, lactobacilli.","Vulvovaginal burning, vulvar itching, dysmenorrhoea, genital, body and abdominal pain. Flu-like syndrome with headache, fever, chills and hypotension with doses >80 mg."
Terbutaline Sulfate,"Terbutaline is a relatively selective β2-adrenergic bronchodilator that has little or no effect on alpha-adrenergic receptors. The drug has exerts a preferential effect on β2-adrenergic receptors but stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors less selectively than relatively selective β2-agonists. Terbutaline appears to have a greater stimulating effect on beta-receptors of the bronchial, vascular, and uterine smooth muscles (β2 receptors) than on the beta-receptors of the heart (β1 receptors). This drug relaxes smooth muscle and inhibits uterine contractions, but may also cause some cardiostimulatory effects and CNS stimulation.The pharmacologic effects of terbutaline are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic- 3',5'- adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP). Increased c-AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.","The frequency of side-effects is low at the recommended doses. Side-effects which have been recorded such as tremor, headache, tonic cramp and palpitations are all characteristic of sympathomimetic amines. A few patients feel tense; this is also due to the effects on skeletal muscle and not to direct CNS stimulation. Whenever these side-effects have occurred the majority have usually been spontaneously reversible within the first week of treatment. Urticaria and exanthema may occur. In children sleep disturbances and disturbances of behavioural effects have been observed. Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from β2-agonist therapy."
Terbinafine Hydrochloride,"Terbinafine, an Allylamine antifungal, inhibits biosynthesis of Ergosterol (an essential component of fungai cell membrane) via inhibition of Squalene Epoxidase enzyme. This results in fungal cell death primarily due to the increased membrane permeability mediated by the accumulation of high concentrations of Squalene but not due to Ergosterol deficiency. Depending on the concentration of the drug and the fungal species test in vitro, Terbinafine hydrochloride may be fungicidal. However, the clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown. Terbinafine has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: Tricophyton Mentagrophyte, Trichophyton Rubrum.","The adverse events reported encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea, dyspepsia and abdominal pain), liver test abnormalities, rashes, urticaria, pruritus, and taste disturbances. In general, the adverse events were mild, transient, and did not lead to discontinuation. Adverse events, based on worldwide experience with terbinafine use, include: idiosyncratic and symptomatic hepatic injury and more rarely, cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant, serious skin reactions, severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, angioedema and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis). Other adverse reactions that have been reported include malaise, fatigue, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, and hair loss."
Terazosin Hydrochloride,"Terazosin is selective for alpha-1-adrenoceptors but not their individual subtypes. Inhibition of these alpha-1-adrenoceptors results in relaxation of smooth muscle in blood vessels and the prostate, lowering blood pressure and improving urinary flow. Smooth muscle cells accounts for roughly 40% of the volume of the prostate and so their relaxation reduces pressure on the urethra.It has also been shown that catecholamines induce factors responsible for mitogenesis and alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers inhibit this effect. A final long term mechanism of terazosin and other alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers is the induction of apoptosis of prostate cells. Treatment with terazosin enhances the expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1), which upregulates p27kip1, and the caspase cascade","Postural hypotension is more commonly reported side effect. Dizziness, lack of energy, peripheral oedema; urinary frequency and priapism reported."
Tenoxicam,"Tenoxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties and it also inhibits platelet aggregation. Tenoxicam inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis. In-vitro tests of leukocyte peroxidase suggest that tenoxicam may act as a scavenger for active oxygen at the site of inflammation. Tenoxicam is a potent in-vitro inhibitor of human metalloproteinases (stromelysin and collagenase), which induce cartilage breakdown. These pharmacological effects explain, at least in part, the therapeutic benefit of Tenoxicam in the treatment of painful inflammatory and degenerative disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Tenoxicam showed no mutagenic, carcinogenic or teratogenic effects in animals. As with other prostaglandin inhibitors, renal and gastrointestinal effects, increased incidence of dystocia and delayed parturition were observed in animal safety studies.","Based on clinical trials including large numbers of patients, Tenoxicam proved to be well tolerated in the recommended dose. Usually, the undesirable effects reported were mild and transient. In a small proportion of patients, the interruption of treatment due to undesirable effects was necessary. Local tolerance of Tenoxicam given parenterally was good. The following undesirable effects have been reported: Frequency is greater than 1%-

Gastrointestinal tract: gastric, epigastric and abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, heartburn, nausea.
Central nervous system: dizziness, headache.

Frequency less than 1%-

Gastrointestinal tract: constipation, diarrhea, stomatitis, gastritis, vomiting, ulcers, Gl-bleeding including hematemesis and melena.
Central nervous system: fatigue, sleep disturbances, appetite loss, dry mouth, vertigo.
Skin: itching (also in the anal region after rectal administration), erythema, exanthema, rash, urticaria.
Urinary tract and kidneys: increase in BUN or creatinine, edema.
Liver and biliary tract: increased liver enzyme activity.
Cardiovascular system: palpitations.

Isolated cases (frequency less than 0.01%)-

Gastrointestinal tract: Gl-perforation.
Central nervous system: visual disturbances.
Skin: Stevens-Johnson and Lyell's syndrome, photosensitivity reaction, vasculitis.
Blood: anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia.
Hypersensitivity reactions: dyspnea, asthma, anaphylaxis, angioedema.
Cardiovascular system: elevated blood pressure, mainly in patients treated with cardiovascular drugs.
Liver/Biliary tract: hepatitis."
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate,"Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate, an acyclic nucleotide analogue of adenosine monophosphate, is a pro-drug of Tenofovir. It shows activity against hepatitis B virus polymerase and HIV reverse transcriptase after phosphorylation to the active diphosphate form. Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits viral polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by directly competing with the natural substrate deoxyribonucleotide and by causing DNA chain termination after its incorporation into viral DNA.","The most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and flatulence."
Tenofovir Alafenamide,"Tenofovir alafenamide is a phosphonamidate prodrug of tenofovir (2'-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analog). Tenofovir alafenamide as a lipophilic cell-permeant compound enters primary hepatocytes by passive diffusion and by the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Tenofovir alafenamide is then converted to tenofovir through hydrolysis primarily by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in primary hepatocytes. Intracellular tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the pharmacologically active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HBV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HBV reverse transcriptase, which results in DNA chain-termination.Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases that include mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ and there is no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in cell culture.","The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:

Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis 
Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B
New Onset or Worsening of Renal Impairment

The most common side effects are headache, stomach pain, tiredness, cough, nausea, back pain"
Tenecteplase,"Tenecteplase is a modified form of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that binds to fibrin and converts plasminogen to plasmin. In the presence of fibrin, in vitro studies demonstrate that Tenecteplase conversion of plasminogen to plasmin is increased relative to its conversion in the absence of fibrin. This fibrin specificity decreases systemic activation of plasminogen and the resulting degradation of circulating fibrinogen as compared to a molecule lacking this property. Following administration of 30, 40, or 50 mg of Tenecteplase, there are decreases in circulating fibrinogen (4%-15%) and plasminogen (11%-24%). The clinical significance of fibrinspecificity on safety (e.g., bleeding) or efficacy has not been established. Biological potency is determined by an in vitro clot lysis assay and is expressed in Tenecteplase-specific units. The specific activity of Tenecteplase has been defined as 200 units/mg.","The most frequent adverse reaction associated with Tenecteplase is bleeding. Should serious bleeding occur, concomitant heparin and antiplatelet therapy should be discontinued. Death or permanent disability can occur in patients who experience stroke or serious bleeding episodes. For Tenecteplase-treated patients in ASSENT-2, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.9% and any stroke was 1.8%. The incidence of all strokes, including intracranial bleeding, increases with increasing age"
Temozolomide,"Temozolomide, a triazene, is an inactive prodrug. It is chemically hydrolysed to 3-methyl-(triazen-1-yl) imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC), the active metabolite of dacarbazine. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is believed to be due alkylation of DNA, mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine.","Nausea, vomiting, taste perversion, constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, stomatitis, anorexia, headache, fatigue, convulsions, dizziness, memory impairment, impaired concentration, tremors, blurred vision, hearing impairment, speech disorder, rash, infection, oral candidiasis, dyspnoea, coughing, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, anaemia, hyperglycemia, decreased wt, insomnia, anxiety, alopecia, muscle weakness, urinary incontinence, increased alanine aminotransferase. Rarely, myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies."
Temazepam,"Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is considered the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human body. When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons.Subsequently, benzodiazepines like temazepam can bind to benzodiazepine receptors that are components of various varieties of GABA(a) receptors. This binding acts to enhance the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA(a) receptor, which ultimately enhances GABA ligand binding at the receptors. This enhanced ligand binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the receptors increases the aforementioned chloride ion conduction (perhaps reportedly via an increase in the frequency of the chloride channel opening), resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the associated neuron cells. Combined with the notion that such benzodiazepine receptor associated GABA(a) receptors exist both peripherally and in the CNS, this activity consequently facilitates various effects like sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action","The most common side effects of temazepam are:

drowsiness
headache
tiredness
nervousness
dizziness
nausea"
Telmisartan + Hydrochlorothiazide,"Telmisartan: Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.There is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II) nor does it bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of telmisartan on blood pressure.Hydrochlorothiazide: Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium salt and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an ARB tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.","Common side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, tired feeling, flushing (warmth, redness, or tingly feeling), back pain, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain. Other adverse events include allergy, fever, leg pain, chest pain, insomnia, somnolence, and dry mouth, elevations of liver enzymes or serum bilirubin, leg cramps, myalgia, dermatitis. Other adverse events that have been reported includes weakness, gastric irritation, photosensitivity, urticaria, muscle spasm, restlessness."
Telmisartan,"Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.","In hypertensive patients: The most common side effects of Telmisartan tablets include sinus pain and congestion (sinusitis), back pain, diarrhea etc. For patients of cardiovascular risk reduction: The most common side effects of Telmisartan tablets in CV risk reduction include intermittent claudication and skin ulcer."
Telbivudine,"Telbivudine is a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analogue with activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Telbivudine is the unmodified β–L enantiomer of the naturally occurring nucleoside, thymidine. It undergoes phosphorylation via interaction with cellular kinases to form the active metabolite, telbivudine 5'-triphosphate.Telbivudine 5'–triphosphate inhibits HBV DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine 5'–triphosphate. This leads to the chain termination of DNA synthesis, thereby inhibiting viral replication. Incorporation of telbivudine 5'–triphosphate into viral DNA also causes DNA chain termination, resulting in inhibition of HBV replication. Telbivudine inhibits anticompliment or second-strand DNA.","Cough, dizziness, fatigue, GI effects (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia), rash, arthralgia, myalgia, myopathy, malaise, back pain, nasopharyngitis, headache, flu or flu-like symptoms, insomnia; increased serum amylase, lipase, creatine phosphokinase, alanine aminotransferase levels; peripheral neuropathy, rhabdomyolysis."
Teicoplanin,"Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that has shown in vitro bactericidal activity against both anaerobic and aerobic gram-positive organisms. Teicoplanin inhibits the growth of susceptible organisms by interfering with cell-wall biosynthesis at a site different from that affected by beta-lactams. It is active against staphylococci (including those resistant to methicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics), streptococci, enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes, micrococci, group JK corynebacteria and gram-positive anaerobes including Clostridium difficile and peptococci.","Teicoplanin is generally well tolerated. Serious side-effects are rare. Side-effects are gastrointestinal like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, CNS associated with urticaria, rash, anaphylactic shock as well as hearing problems like vertigo, tinnitus and vestibular disorder may occur."
Tegaserod,"Tegaserod is a serotonin type-4 (5HT4) receptor partial agonist. Tegaserod binds with high affinity at human 5HT4 receptors, present on caudate membranes, whereas it has no appreciable affinity for human recombinant 5HT3 receptors or human recombinant dopamine D2 receptors. In vitro and animal study has revealed that Tegaserod can trigger the peristaltic reflex via 5HT4 receptor activation and thereby enhance basal motor activity and normalize impaired GI motility.","Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, headache, fatigue, back pain etc."
Tioconazole,"Tioconazole interacts with 14-α demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the yeast membrane. In this way, tioconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, resulting in increased cellular permeability. Tioconazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms and the uptake of purine, impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis, and inhibit the movement of calcium and potassium ions across the cell membrane by blocking the ion transport pathway known as the Gardos channel.","Occasional local transient & mild irritation; if hypersensitivity reaction develop, treatment should be discontinued & appropriate therapy should be instituted."
Tinidazole,"Tinidazole, a 5-nitroimidazole derivative with antimicrobial actions similar to metronidazole, is active against both protozoa (e.g. Trichomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia) and obligate anaerobic bacteria. It damages DNA strands or inhibits DNA synthesis in microorganism.","Reported side effects have generally been infrequent, mild and self-limiting. Side effects from the gastrointestinal tract include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea and metallic taste. Hypersensitivity reactions, occasionally severe, may occur in rare cases in the form of skin rash, pruritis, urticaria and angioneurotic oedema. As with related compounds, tinidazole may produce transient leukopenia. Other rarely reported side-effects are headache, tiredness, furry tongue and dark urine."
Timolol Maleate,"Timolol is a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor blocker. It does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, direct myocardial depressant activity or local anaesth activity. Exact mechanism of ocular hypotensive effect is unclear, but it is thought to be related to reduction of aqueous humour formation. β-blockade also causes lowering of BP.","Burning and stinging sensation of the eyes, bradycardia, hypotension, arrhythmia and AV or SA nodal block, CHF, pulmonary oedema, Raynaud's phenomenon, headache, dizziness, fatigue, asthenia, abdominal discomfort, nausea, constipation, hypoglycaemia."
Tigecycline,"Tigecycline, a glycylcycline, inhibits protein translation in bacteria by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and blocking entry of amino-acyl tRNA molecules into the A site of the ribosome. This prevents incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains. Tigecycline carries a glycylamido moiety attached to the 9-position of minocycline. The substitution pattern is not present in any naturally occurring or semisynthetic tetracycline and imparts certain microbiologic properties to tigecycline. Tigecycline is not affected by the two major tetracycline resistance mechanisms, ribosomal protection and efflux. Accordingly, tigecycline has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens. There has been no cross resistance observed between tigecycline and other antibiotics. Tigecycline is not affected by resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamases (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), target site modifications, macrolide efflux pumps or enzyme target changes (e.g. gyrase/topoisomerase). In vitro studies have not demonstrated antagonism between tigecycline and other commonly used antibacterial drugs. In general, tigecycline is considered bacteriostatic.","The most common treatment-emergent adverse events are nausea and vomiting which generally occurre during the first 1-2 days of therapy. The following drug-related adverse events are reported infrequently in patients receiving Tigecycline: Injection site inflammation & pain, septic shock, allergic reaction, chills, thrombophlebitis, bradycardia, tachycardia, vasodilatation, anorexia, dry mouth, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, prolonged prothrombin time, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, vaginal moniliasis, vaginitis, leukorrhea."
Tiemonium Methylsulphate,"Tiemonium Methylsulphate a competitive antagonist of Acetylcholine, Histamine and strengthens of calcium bond with membrane phospholipids and proteins. Thus inhibits intracellular contractile protein of visceral cell which causes inhibition of visceral spasm and pain.",Tiemonium Methylsulphate may have the risk of hypotension & tachycardia in certain individuals.
Ticlopidine Hydrochloride,"When taken orally, Ticlopidine hydrochloride causes a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of both platelet aggregation and release of platelet granule constituents, as well as a prolongation of bleeding time. The intact drug has no significant in vitro activity at the concentrations attained in vivo; and, although analysis of urine and plasma indicates at least 20 metabolites, no metabolite which accounts for the activity of ticlopidine has been isolated.Ticlopidine hydrochloride, after oral ingestion, interferes with platelet membrane function by inhibiting ADP-induced platelet-fibrinogen binding and subsequent platelet-platelet interactions. The effect on platelet function is irreversible for the life of the platelet, as shown both by persistent inhibition of fibrinogen binding after washing platelets ex vivo and by inhibition of platelet aggregation after resuspension of platelets in buffered medium.","Diarrhoea, nausea, dyspepsia, bleeding, pupura, skin rash, increase in serum cholesterol concentration, elevation of LFTs, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice."
Ticagrelor,"Ticagrelor is a selective adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonist acting on the P2Y12 ADP-receptor that can prevent ADP-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. Ticagrelor reversibly interacts with the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor.Ticagrelor does not interact with the ADP binding site itself, but interacts with platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction.Thus it prevents platelet activation & aggregation.","Dyspnea,bleeding,headache,cough,dizziness,nausea,atrial fibrillation, hypertension, non-cardiac chest pain, diarrhea, back pain, hypotension, fatigue, chest pain."
Tibolone,"Tibolone is a synthetic steroid that has estrogenic, androgenic and progestagenic properties. After oral administration, Tibolone is rapidly metabolized into three compounds which contribute to the pharmacological effects of Tibolone. Two of these metabolites (the 3α−OH and 3β−OH metabolite) have predominantly estrogenic activity; a third metabolite (δ4-isomer of Tibolone) and the parent compound have predominantly progestagenic and androgenic activities. Tibolone substitutes for the loss of estrogen production in postmenopausal women and alleviates menopausal symptoms. It prevents bone loss following menopause or ovariectomy. It has estrogenic effects on the vagina, on bone and on the thermoregulatory centers in the brain (hot flushes). It improves vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy. Tibolone has also effects on mood and libido.","Occasionally, vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur, mainly during the first months of treatment. Other adverse effects are headache and migraine, oedema, dizziness, pruritus, increase in body weight, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, and depression."
Thioridazine,Thioridazine is a piperidine phenothiazine which blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic receptors in the brain. It exhibits a strong α-adrenergic blocking effect and depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones.,"Tardive dyskinesia; leucopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis; drowsiness, pseudoparkinsonism and other extrapyramidal symptoms; dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, nasal stuffiness, pallor; galactorrhoea, breast engorgement, amenorrhoea, inhibition of ejaculation, peripheral oedema; dermatitis, skin eruptions. Rarely, nocturnal confusion, hyperactivity, lethargy, psychotic reactions, restlessness, headache, photosensitivity, parotid swelling."
Thiopental Sodium,"Thiopental, a barbiturate, is used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the use of other general anesthetic agents and for induction of anesthesia for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures associated with minimal painful stimuli. Thiopental is an ultrashort-acting depressant of the central nervous system which induces hypnosis and anesthesia, but not analgesia. It produces hypnosis within 30 to 40 seconds of intravenous injection. Recovery after a small dose is rapid, with some somnolence and retrograde amnesia. Repeated intravenous doses lead to prolonged anesthesia because fatty tissues act as a reservoir; they accumulate Pentothal in concentrations 6 to 12 times greater than the plasma concentration, and then release the drug slowly to cause prolonged anesthesiaThiopental binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged.","Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Other adverse reactions to thiopental sodium include the followings: respiratory depression, myocardial depression, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged somnolence and recovery, hypotension, tachycardia, sneezing, coughing, bronchospasm, laryngospasm and shivering. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Symptoms, e.g., urticaria, bronchospasm, vasodilation and edema."
Thiamine Hydrochloride,"Thiamine, in the form of thiamine pyrophosphate, is the coenzyme for decarboxylation of α-ketoglutaric acid. Thiamine deficiency affects the peripheral nervous system, the gastrointestinal tract, and the cardiovascular system. This vitamin is necessary for the optimal growth of infants and children. Thiamine is not stored in the body, and is regularly lost from tissues during short periods of deficiency. In order to maintain normal health, an adequate amount of thiamine is required every day. Deficiency of thiamine leads to fatigue, anorexia, gastrointestinal disturbance, tachycardia, irritability and neurological symptoms. Beriberi, a disease due to vitamin B1 deficiency, is common in alcoholics, in pregnant women receiving an inadequate diet, and in people with malabsorption syndrome, prolonged diarrhoea and hepatic disease.Thiamine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and widely distributed throughout the body. Thiamine is rapidly absorbed from the upper small intestine. Thiamine is not stored in the body to any appreciable extent. Excess ingested thiamine appears in urine as intact thiamine or as pyrimidine, which arises from degradation of the thiamine molecule. The plasma half life of thiamine is 24 hours.","Vitamin B1 does not have adverse effects when given orally, but in a few fatal cases anaphylactic reactions have occurred after intravenous administration of large doses (400 mg) in sensitive patients, especially children, and in one case following an intramuscular dose of 125 mg. The risk of such reactions increases with repeated administration of the drug by parenteral route. Transient mild soreness may occur at the site of intramuscular administration"
Theophylline,"Theophylline is a bronchodilator, structurally classified as a Methylxanthine. Theophylline has two distinct actions in the airways of patients with reversible obstruction; smooth muscle relaxation and suppression of the response of the airways to stimuli. Theophylline also increases the force of contraction of diaphragmatic muscles. The half-life of Theophylline is influenced by a number of known variables. In adult nonsmokers with uncomplicated asthma the half-life ranges from 3 to 9 hours","Generally side effects are rare at normal dosage. It may include gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, insomnia and hypotension. CNS stimulation and diuresis may also occur, especially in children."
Thalidomide,"Thalidomide is a synthetic glutamic acid derivative immunomodulator with anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenetic, sedative and hypnotic activity.In patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) the mechanism of action is not fully understood. Available data from in vitro studies and preliminary clinical trials suggest that the immunologic effects of this compound can vary substantially under different conditions, but may be related to suppression of excessive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) production and down-modulation of selected cell surface adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte migration. For example, administration of thalidomide has been reported to decrease circulating levels of TNF-a in patients with ENL, however, it has also been shown to increase plasma TNF-a levels in HIV-seropositive patients. As a cancer treatment, the drug may act as a VEGF inhibitor.","Severe and irreversible peripheral neuropathy, constipation, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, drowsiness, somnolence, bradycardia, increase of viral load in HIV-infected patients, hypersensitivity reaction."
Tetracycline Hydrochloride (Topical),"Tetracycline passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane and reversibly binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing binding of tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex, and thus interfering with protein synthesis.","Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention."
Tetracycline Hydrochloride (Oral),"Tetracycline has its main mechanism of action on protein synthesis, and an energy-dependent active transport system pumps the drug through the inner cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. Once inside the bacterial cell, Tetracycline binds specifically to the 30s ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis.Many Gram positive aerobic Cocci are susceptible, but many strains of staphylococci, streptococci and even some pneumococci are resistant to Tetracycline. Thus, tetracycline is not the drug of choice in infections due to gram positive aerobes.Pseudomonas and many Enterobacteriaceae are resistant. Urinary concentrations are adequate for some community - acquired E. coli and consequently, Tetracycline is still used in uncomplicated initial UTIs. Tetracycline is also active against and is the drug of choice for Brucella species, Calymmatobacterium granulomatis, Vibrio cholerae and V. vulnificus.Tetracycline is also active against anaerobic species of bacteria and since concentrations of the drug are quite high in the gastrointestinal contents, the enteric flora are usually altered by the drug.Tetracycline is incompletely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract, about 60 to 80% of a dose of tetracycline usually being available. It is widely distributed through the body tissues and fluids.Tetracycline has a half-life of about 12 hours. It is excreted in the urine and in the faeces.","Teeth and bone: Tetracycline can cause depression of bone growth, permanent graybrown discoloration of the teeth and enamel hypoplasia when given during tooth development (i.e. during the later half of pregnancy, during infancy and in childhood).Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, urticaria and rashes are uncommon. Photosensitivity reactions consisting of a red rash on areas exposed to intense sunlight can occur with Tetracycline.Gastrointestinal effects: Epigastric distress and nausea are commonly seen after oral administration, and these symptoms are somewhat dose related. Vomiting can occur.Accentuated prerenal azotemia: Tetracycline appears to aggravate pre-existing renal failure by inhibiting protein synthesis, which increases the azotemia from amino acid metabolism.Superinfections with oral and anogenital candidiasis are relatively common in patients taking Tetracycline.Esophageal ulcerations: In most cases, the patients were taking the capsules with little or no fluid before going to bed. To help minimize this, oral doses should be given with adequate amounts of fluid."
Tetracycline Hydrochloride (Ophthalmic),"Tetracycline exhibits its bacteriostatic action by reversibly binding to the 30S subunits of the ribosome, thus preventing protein synthesis and arresting cell growth. It has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity including Chlamydiaceae, Mycoplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., spirochaetes, many aerobic and anaerobic gm+ve and gm-ve pathogenic bacteria and some protozoa.","Burning, irritation, visual disturbances, superinfections, photosensitivity, hypersensitivity"
Tetrabenazine,"Prolongation of the QTc interval has been observed at doses of 50 mg. In rats, it has been observed that tetrabenazine or its metabolites bind to melanin-containing tissues such as the eyes and skin. After a single oral dose of radiolabeled tetrabenazine, radioactivity was still detected in eye and fur at 21 days post dosing.Tetrabenazine is a reversible human vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitor (Ki = 100 nM). It acts within the basal ganglia and promotes depletion of monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine from stores. It also decreases uptake into synaptic vesicles. Dopamine is required for fine motor movement, so the inhibition of its transmission is efficacious for hyperkinetic movement. Tetrabenazine exhibits weak in vitro binding affinity at the dopamine D2 receptor (Ki = 2100 nM).","The following serious adverse reactions are Depression, Suicidality Akathisia, restlessness, and agitation, Parkinsonism, Dysphagia, Sedation and somnolence"
Tetanus Antitoxin [Equine],"This is a sterile clear, faintly yellow or brown liquid of tetanus antitoxin (equine) for human use. It is a preparation containing antitoxic globulins that have the power of specifically neutralizing the toxin formed by Clostridium tetani. It is obtained by fractionation from the serum of horses that have been hyperimmunized against tetanus toxin.","Hypersensitive reactions may occur after the injection of any serum of animal origin. In rare cases hypotension, dyspnoea, urticaria may occur. It should be treated with adrenalin, possibly in association with antihistamine and corticosteroid therapy. Serum sickness may occur 7 to 10 days after injection of serum of animal origin; symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, bronchospasm and urticaria."
Trastuzumab,"The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. Trastuzumab is a mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, Trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2.","The most serious adverse reactions caused by Trastuzumab includes Cardiomyopathy, Infusion Reactions, Embryo-Fetal Toxicity, Pulmonary Toxicity, Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia. The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving Trastuzumab in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer setting are fever, nausea, vomiting, infusion reactions, diarrhea, infections, increased cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, neutropenia, anemia, and myalgia."
Tranexamic Acid,"This is a preparation of tranexamic acid (trans-4 aminomethyl-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid). Tranexamic acid is a substance endowed with a strong antifibrinolytic action and both in vivo and in vitro it has proved to be 10 times more active than conventional hemostatics, depending on the test. The antihemorrhagic action of tranexamic acid is essentially due to an inhibition of the plasminogen activation of both exogenous activators like streptokinase and endogenous ones like urokinase and the plasminogen tissue activator. This fact is particularly important for the clinical use of Tranexamic Acid, because it ensures an antihemorrhagic activity with an antifibrinolytic mechanism under a variety of conditions.The acute toxicity of Tranexamic Acid is extremely low and chronic toxicity almost non-existent. Tranexamic Acid is well absorbed by oral route and the effect is already seen 15-30 minutes after administration. It is excreted mainly by renal route but more slowly than conventional hemostatics. These features make the Tranexamic Acid effect more lasting than those conventional hemostatics. Considerably lower single doses of Tranexamic Acid can thus be administered at greater intervals without the drug plasma levels dropping to inefficient levels of antifibrinolytic activity between one dose and the other.Tranexamic Acid at therapeutic doses does not interfere with clotting processes and even a prolonged administration has not been seen to be accompanied by any tendency to thrombophilia.","Tranexamic Acid is generally well tolerated; there may be infrequent cases of sense of fatigue, conjunctival irritation, nasal blockage, itching, skin reddening, exanthems.
After oral administration there may be sign of nausea, diarrhea, gastric pyrosis.
There are rare cases of postural hypotension.
In the case of hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid, avoid or suspend treatment and start a suitable therapy."
Tramadol Hydrochloride,Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic compound. It inhibits the re uptake of neurotransmitters- serotonin and noradrenaline. Thus it modifies the transmission of pain impulses by activating both descending serotonergic pathways and noradrenergic pathways involved in analgesia. The analgesic effects of Tramadol are mediated via stimulation of mu-opioid receptors and indirect modulation of central monoaminergic inhibitory pathways.,"Commonly occurring side-effects are dizziness/vertigo, nausea, constipation, headache, somnolence, vomiting, pruritus, CNS stimulation, asthenia, sweating, dyspepsia, dry mouth, diarrhoea. Less commonly occurring side-effects include malaise, allergic reaction, weight loss, vasodilatation, palpitations, abdominal pain, anorexia, flatulence, GI bleeding, hepatitis, stomatitis etc."
Torasemide,"Torasemide inhibits the Na+/K+/2CI- carrier system (via interference of the chloride binding site) in the lumen of the thick ascending portion of the loop of Henle, resulting in a decrease in reabsorption of sodium and chloride. This results in an increase in the rate of delivery of tubular fluid and electrolytes to the distal sites of hydrogen and potassium ion secretion, while plasma volume contraction increases aldosterone production. The increased delivery and high aldosterone levels promote sodium reabsorption at the distal tubules, and By increasing the delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, torasemide indirectly increases potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. Torasemide's effects in other segments of the nephron have not been demonstrated. Thus torasemide increases the urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, but it does not significantly alter glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or acid-base balance. Torasemide's effects as a antihypertensive are due to its diuretic actions. By reducing extracellular and plasma fluid volume, blood pressure is reduced temporarily, and cardiac output also decreases.","Usually torasemide is well tolerated. However, a few side effects like dry mouth, dizziness, tiredness, skin rash, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, orthostatic hypotention and muscle cramp may occur. All side effects usually are mild and transient."
Topotecan,"Topotecan has the same mechanism of action as irinotecan and is believed to exert its cytotoxic effects during the S-phase of DNA synthesis. Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks. This ternary complex interferes with the moving replication fork, which leads to the induction of replication arrest and lethal double-stranded breaks in DNA. As mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks, the formation of this ternary complex eventually leads to apoptosis (programmed cell death).Topotecan mimics a DNA base pair and binds at the site of DNA cleavage by intercalating between the upstream (-1) and downstream (+1) base pairs. Intercalation displaces the downstream DNA, thus preventing religation of the cleaved strand. By specifically binding to the enzyme–substrate complex, Topotecan acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor.","Neutropenia (nadir of white cell count occurs about 9-12 days after admin), thrombocytopenia and anaemia. GI upset, total alopecia, headache, dyspnoea. Fatigue, weakness, malaise, pruritus and hyperbilirubinaemia."
Topiramate,"A seizure is an abnormal and unregulated electrical discharge occurring in the brain. This leads to a transient interruption in brain function, manifested by reduced alertness, abnormal sensations, and focal involuntary movements or convulsions. Several types of seizures exist, with common types including tonic-clonic seizures and partial onset seizures.The exact mechanisms by which topiramate exerts pharmacological actions on seizures and migraines are currently not fully characterized. Several properties of this drug, however, are likely to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors.Topiramate stimulates GABA-A receptor activity at brain non-benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduces glutamate activity at both AMPA and kainate receptors. Normally, GABA-A receptors are inhibitory and glutaminergic receptors are stimulatory for neuronal activity. By increasing GABA activity and inhibiting glutamate activity, topiramate blocks neuronal excitability, preventing seizures and migraines. Additionally, it blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channels, further blocking seizure activity. Topiramate has been shown to inhibit various carbonic anhydrase isozymes, but the clinical significance of this is unknown at this time.","Nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, dry mouth, taste disturbance, weight loss, anorexia, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, headache, fatigue, dizziness, speech disorder, drowsiness, insomnia, impaired memory & concentration, anxiety, depression, visual disturbance, lesscommonly: sucidal ideation, rarely: reduced sweetening mainly children, metabolic acidosis and alopecia, very rarely: Leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and serious skin reaction."
Tolvaptan,"Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist. Tolvaptan affinity for the V2-receptor is 29 times greater than for the V1a-receptor. When taken orally, 15 to 60 mg doses of Tolvaptan antagonize the effect of vasopressin and cause an increase in urine water excretion that results in an increase in free water clearance (aquaresis), a decrease in urine osmolality, and a resulting increase in serum sodium concentrations. Urinary excretion of sodium and potassium and plasma potassium concentrations are not significantly changed.","The most common side effects of Tolvaptan are: thirst, dry mouth, weakness, constipation, making large amounts of urine and urinating often & increased blood sugar levels."
Tolterodine Tartrate,"Tolterodine is a competitive, specific muscarinic receptor antagonist which exhibits a selectivity for the urinary bladder over salivary glands, which have been demonstrated in non clinical pharmacological in vivo studies. Tolterodine has a high specificity for muscarinic receptors. A major active metabolite (5-hydroxymethyl derivative) of tolterodine exhibits a pharmacological profile which is similar to that of the parent compound. In extensive metabolisers this metabolite contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect of tolterodine. The effect of treatment can be expected within 4 weeks.","Tolterodine may cause mild to moderate antimuscarinic effects, like dryness of mouth, dyspepsia and/or reduced lacrimation."
Tolperisone Hydrochloride,"Tolperisone Hydrochloride is a centrally acting muscle relaxant, which acts on the central nervous system and used mainly for the treatment of elevated muscle tone and tension as well as for certain circulation problems in the extremities.","Possible side-effects include sometimes muscular weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting and rarely hypersensitivity reactions (itching, redness of the skin, skin rash) may occur."
Tolperisone + Lidocaine,"Tolperisone Hydrochloride is a centrally acting muscle relaxant. It effectively reduces muscular hypertonicity, improves peripheral blood flow by vasodilatation and reduces pain. Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.","Sometimes, muscular weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting and rarely hypersensitivity reactions may occur as side effects."
Tolnaftate,"Tolnaftate is an antifungal which inhibits growth of dermatophytes e.g. Epidermophyton, Microsporum, trichophyton spp, and Malassezia furfur by distorting the hyphae and stopping mycelial growth. It is inactive against Candida spp or bacteria.","Irritation of the treated skin may occur. If this effect persists or worsens, notify your doctor or pharmacist promptly.If your doctor has directed you to use this medication, remember that he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is unlikely, but seek immediate medical attention if it occurs. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing.This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist."
Tolfenamic acid,"Tolfenamic acid (N-(2-methyl-3-chlorophenyl) anthranilic acid) belongs to the fenamate group and is a potent inhibitor of cyclooxygenase enzyme, thus it inhibits the synthesis of important inflammatory mediators such as thromboxane (TX) B2 and prostaglandin (PG) E2. Prostaglandins are responsible for causing swelling pain and inflammation associated with these conditions. It acts not only by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, but it also has direct antagonistic action on its receptors.Pharmacokinetic properties: Absorption Readily absorbed from GI tract. Peak plasma concentration: 60-90 min. Bioavailability 85%. Distribution: Protein-binding: 99% Plasma half-life 2 hours. Metabolism: Metabolised in the liver. Tolfenamic acid undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Excretion: Excreted in urine (90%) and faces.","Dysuria especially in males, diarrhoea, nausea epigastric pain, vomiting, dyspepsia, erythema, headache, tremor, euphoria, fatigue, pulmonary infiltration & haematuria. Potentially fatal: Blood dyscrasias and hepatitis."
Tofacitinib,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by a dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL7, IL15, IL21, IL6, IFN-alpha, and IFN-beta. (3) Cytokines signalling results in tissue inflammation and joint damage by stimulating the recruitment and activation of immune cells via the janus kinase signalling pathway.Tofacitinib is a partial and reversible janus kinase (JAK) inihibitor that will prevent the body from responding to cytokine signals. By inhibiting JAKs, tofacitinib prevents the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is involved in the transcription of cells involved in hematopoiesis, and immune cell function. Tofacitinib works therapeutically by inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway to decrease the inflammatory response. However, there is evidence to suggest that it may also achieve efficacy via other pathways as well.","The most commonly reported adverse reactions during the first 3 months in controlled clinical trials (occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with Tofacitinib monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infections, headache, diarrhea and nasopharyngitis."
Tocilizumab,"Tocilizumab binds to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R), and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts. IL-6 has been shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, initiation of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. IL-6 is also produced by synovial and endothelial cells leading to local production of IL-6 in joints affected by inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis.","Most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 5%): upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension, increased ALT, injection site reactions."
Tobramycin (Ophthalmic),"Like other aminoglycosides, the bactericidal activity of Tobramycin is taken up into sensitive bacterial cells by an active transport process. Within the cell Tobramycin bind to the 30s, and to some extent to the 50s subunits of the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis and generating errors in the transcription of the genetic code. The manner in which cell death is brought about is imperfectly understood, and other mechanisms may contribute, including effects on membrane permeability.","The most frequent side effect of Tobramycin ophthalmic solution is localized ocular toxicity, conjunctival erythema, hypersensitivity including lid itching and swelling."
Tobramycin (Nebuliser Solution),"Tobramycin interferes with bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits, resulting in a defective bacterial cell membrane.",Inhaled Tobramycin is generally well-tolerated. Voice alterations and tinnitus are more common in the on-drug periods. However all the episodes are transient and resolved without discontinuation of the regimen. Others like dizziness and increase in serum creatinine were similar to those occurring with placebo.
Tizanidine Hydrochloride,"Tizanidine is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant. Its principal site of action is the spinal cord, where the evidence suggests that, by stimulating presynaptic alpha2 receptors, it inhibits the release of excitatory amino acids that stimulate N-methyl-D aspartate (NMDA) receptors.Polysynaptic signal transmission at spinal interneuron level, which is responsible for excessive muscle tone, is thus inhibited and muscle tone reduced. In addition to its muscle-relaxant properties, tizanidine also exerts a moderate central analgesic effect.Pharmacodynamic: Tizanidine is effective in both acute painful muscle spasms and chronic spasticity of spinal and cerebral origin. It reduces resistance to passive movements, alleviates spasms and clonus, and may improve voluntary strength. The antispastic activity (measured by the Ashworth score and pendulum test) and adverse effects (heart rate and blood pressure) of Tizanidine are related to plasma tizanidine concentrations.","With low doses, such as those recommended for the relief of painful muscle spasms, somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, dry mouth, blood pressure decrease, nausea, gastrointestinal disorder and transaminase increase have been reported, usually as mild and transient adverse reactions.With the higher doses recommended for the treatment of spasticity, the adverse reactions reported with low doses are more frequent and more pronounced, but seldom severe enough to require discontinuation of treatment. In addition, the following adverse reactions may occur: hypotension, bradycardia, muscular weakness, insomnia, sleep disorder, hallucination & hepatitis.

Psychiatric disorders: Common- Insomnia, sleep disorder.
Nervous system disorders: Very common- Somnolence, dizziness
Cardiac disorders: Uncommon- Bradycardia
Vascular disorders: Common- Hypotension
Gastrointestinal disorders: Very common- Gastrointestinal disorder, dry mouth; Common- Nausea.
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Very common- Muscular weakness
General disorders and administration site conditions: Very common- Fatigue
Investigations: Common- Blood pressure decreased, transaminases increased."

Tiotropium (Dry Powder Inhaler),"Tiotropium is a long-acting, antimuscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors, M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3-receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The bronchodilation following inhalation of Tiotropium is predominantly a site-specific effect.","The most commonly reported adverse drug reaction was dry mouth. Dry mouth was usually mild and often resolved during continued treatment. Other reactions reported in individual patients and consistent with possible anticholinergic effects included constipation, increased heart rate, blurred vision, glaucoma, urinary difficulty, and urinary retention."
Tropicamide + Phenylephrine Hydrochloride,"Tropicamide binds to and blocks the receptors in the muscles of the eye (muscarinic receptor M4). Tropicamide acts by blocking the responses of the iris sphincter muscle to the iris and ciliary muscles to cholinergic stimulation, producing dilation of the pupil and paralysis of the ciliary muscle.Phenylephrine Hydrochloride is a selective alpha-1 agonist, which causes mydriasis without cycloplegia. It tends to reduce intraocular lesion by vasoconstrictor action.","Elevated IOP (occasionally), stinging, blurred vision, tachycardia, photophobia, headache, parasympathetic stimulation and allergic reactions. Systemic effects include arrhythmias, hypertension and coronary artery spasm."
Tropicamide,"Tropicamide binds to and blocks the receptors in the muscles of the eye (muscarinic receptor M4). Tropicamide acts by blocking the responses of the iris sphincter muscle to the iris and ciliary muscles to cholinergic stimulation, producing dilation of the pupil and paralysis of the ciliary muscle.","Transient stinging, blurred vision, photophobia and superficial punctate keratitis have been reported with the use of tropicamide. Increased intraocular pressure has been reported following the use of mydriatics. Dryness of the mouth, tachycardia, headache, allergic reactions, nausea, vomiting, pallor, central nervous system disturbances and muscle rigidity have been reported with the use of tropicamide."
Trimipramine,"Trimipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant. It was thought that tricyclic antidepressants work by inhibiting the re-uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells. However, this response occurs immediately, yet mood does not lift for around two weeks. It is now thought that changes occur in receptor sensitivity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system, a part of the brain involved in emotions. Presynaptic receptors are affected: a1 and b1 receptors are sensitized, a2 receptors are desensitised (leading to increased noradrenaline production). Tricyclics are also known as effective analgesics for different types of pain, especially neuropathic or neuralgic pain. A precise mechanism for their analgesic action is unknown, but it is thought that they modulate anti-pain opioid systems in the CNS via an indirect serotonergic route. They are also effective in migraine prophylaxis, but not in abortion of acute migraine attack. The mechanism of their anti-migraine action is also thought to be serotonergic.","Dry mouth, accommodation disturbances, tachycardia, constipation, hesitancy of micturation, drowsiness, sweating, postural hypotension, skin rashes, cholestatic jaundice, hypomania, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias and peripheral neuropathy. Agitation, confusion (elderly)."
Trimetazidine Dihydrochloride,"Trimetazidine Dihydrochloride is the first 3- keto acyl CoA thiolase inhibitor (KAT), a metabolic anti-ischemic agent with proven benefits for all coronary patients. Trimetazidine Dihydrochloride inhibits fatty acid pathway by inhibiting 3-keto acyl CoA thiolase enzyme and transfers oxygen to glucose pathway. Since glucose pathway is more efficient in producing energy, the same oxygen produces more energy and makes the heart more active. Moreover, the aerobic oxidation of glucose stops production of lactic acid, which prevents angina pectoris.","Trimetazidine is safe and well tolerated. The Common side effects associated with Trimetazidine are dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, rash, pruritus, urticaria and asthenia"
Trimebutine Maleate,"Trimebutine maleate is a noncompetitive spasmolytic agent. It possesses moderate opiate receptor affinity and has marked anti-serotonin activity especially on 'mu' receptors. It induces regulation of spontaneous activity and increases synchronization between electrophysiological spikes and contractions in isolated guinea pig strips of colon and ileum. However, it does not alter normal motility, but regulates abnormal intestinal activity.","Trimebutine maleate is generally well tolerated. The infrequently reported adverse effects are as follows: dry mouth, foul taste, diarrhea, dyspepsia, epigastric pain, nausea, constipation, drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, hot/cold sensations, headache etc."
Trihexyphenidyl Hydrochloride,"Trihexyphenidyl is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist but binds with higher affinity to the M1 subtype. In vivo studies have shown that trihexyphenidyl demonstrates higher affinity for central muscarinic receptors located in the cerebral cortex and lower affinity for those located peripherally. Other studies suggest that trihexyphenidyl may modify nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmission, leading indirectly to enhanced dopamine release in the striatum. Although the anticholinergic has proven to be useful in the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease or other movement disorders, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated.","Minor side effects such as dryness of the mouth, blurring of vision, dizziness, mild nausea or nervousness. Patients with arteriosclerosis or with a history of idiosyncrasy to other drugs may exhibit reactions of mental confusion, agitation, disturbed behavior, or nausea and vomiting. Potential side effects are constipation, drowsiness, urinary hesitancy or retention, pupil dilation, increased intraocular tension, vomiting and headache."
Trifluridine,"Trifluridine is a fluorinated pyrimidine nucleoside analog which interferes with DNA synthesis of herpes simplex virus, type 1 and 2 and vaccinia virus. It stops replication of herpes viral DNA in 3 ways: 

Competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase,
Incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain and
Inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase.","Reported side effects are mild, transient burning or stinging sensation upon instillation. Other side effects are superficial punctate keratopathy, epithelial keratopathy, hypersensitivity reaction, stromal edema, irritation, keratitis sicca, hyperemia and increased intraocular pressure."
Trifluoperazine,"Trifluoperazine is one of the phenothiazine class of compounds and as such has many pharmacodynamic effects which relate to its therapeutic actions and side effects. The most notable action of phenothiazines is antagonism at dopamine receptors in the CNS. It is hypothesised that this action in the limbic system and associated areas of cerebral cortex is the basis of the antipsychotic action of phenothiazines, whilst in the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone it appears to be responsible for the antiemetic effect of these agents.","Common side effects are transient restlessness, dystonias or may resemble parkinsonism. Other CNS Reactions are drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, blurred vision, seizures. Without these Peripheral oedema, blood dyscrasias, jaundice may occasionally occur. Tachycardia, constipation, urinary hesitancy and retention and hyperpyrexia have been reported very rarely."
Trifarotene,"Trifarotene is an agonist of retinoic acid receptors (RAR), with particular activity at the gamma subtype of RAR. Stimulation of RAR results in modulation of target genes which are associated with various processes, including cell differentiation and mediation of inflammation. The exact process by which Trifarotene ameliorates acne is unknown.","Most common adverse reactions (incidence >1%) in patients treated with Trifarotene cream were application site irritation, application site pruritus, and sunburn."
Triamcinolone Acetonide (Topical),"Triamcinolone Acetonide (a derivative of Triamcinolone) in a compatible base. Topical steroids are primarily effective because of their anti-inflammatory, antipruritic & vasoconstrictive actions.","The following local side effects have been reported with topical corticosteroids, either with or without occlusive dressings: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae and miliaria."
Triamcinolone Acetonide (Nasal Spray),"The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition of arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Firstly, however, these glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptors which translocate into the nucleus and bind DNA (GRE) and change genetic expression both positively and negatively. The immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.Triamcinolone Acetonide is a more potent derivative of Triamcinolone and is approximately 8 times more potent than prednisone. Corticosteroids are very effective in the treatment of allergic diseases in man. When given by intranasal spray, Triamcinolone Acetonide provides relief from allergy-induced watery nasal discharge (rhinorrhea), nasal congestion, postnasal drip, sneezing, and itching of the back of the throat.","The most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials with Triamcinolone included those involving mucous membranes of the nose & throat. The most prevalent adverse reactions considered are rhinitis, headache, & pharyngitis. The nasopharyngeal adverse effects included epistaxis, nasal irritation, dry mucous membrane, naso-sinus congestion and sneezing although these are seen as frequently with placebo. As with other nasally inhaled corticosteroids, nasal septal perforation has been reported."
Triamcinolone Acetonide (Injection),"The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition of arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Firstly, however, these glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptors which translocate into the nucleus and bind DNA (GRE) and change genetic expression both positively and negatively. The immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.","Cushingoid syndrome, weakness, bruising or purpura, aggravation of infections, peptic ulcer, activation of latent or aggravation of existing diabetes, altered menstrual cycle, hirsutism."
Triamcinolone + Neomycin + Nystatin + Gramicidin,"Triamcinolone is a fluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and anti-allergic actions. Nystatin, a polyene antifungal antibiotic, binds to ergosterol and interferes with the permeability of cell membrane of susceptible fungi e.g Candida spp. Neomycin is an aminoglycoside, often used topically in the infections against susceptible staphylococci and other organisms. Gramicidin, an antibacterial substance extracted from tyrothricin, is active against many Grampositive bacteria. Used together, this combination provides a wide coverage against gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria and yeast which are responsible for most of the skin infections.","Prolonged use may cause sensitivity reactions, impaired wound healing, thinning of skin, striae, telangiectasia, hirsutism, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome."
Tretinoin (Topical),"Although the exact mode of action of Tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical Tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally Tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increases turnover of follicular epithelial cells, causing extrusion of the comedones, papules and pustules.","Initial external application of Tretinoin generally may cause burning or slight irritation, erythema and peeling at the site of application may also occur. If irritation becomes severe and persists, discontinue application and consult your physicians, if necessary."
Tretinoin (Oral),"Tretinoin is not a cytolytic agent but instead induces cytodifferentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells in culture and in vivo. In APL patients, tretinoin treatment produces an initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission (CR). The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in APL is unknown.","Virtually all patients experience some drug-related toxicity, especially headache, fever, weakness, and fatigue. These adverse effects are seldom permanent or irreversible nor do they usually require interruption of therapy. Some of the adverse events are common in patients with APL, including hemorrhage, infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pneumonia, septicemia, and cerebral hemorrhage. The following describes the adverse events, regardless of drug relationship, that were observed in patients treated with Tretinoin."
Trelagliptin Succinate,"It controls blood glucose levels by selectively and continually inhibiting DPP-4, an enzyme that causes the inactivation of glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, incretin hormones that play an important role in blood glucose regulation. The inhibition of DPP-4 increases insulin secretion depending on blood glucose concentration, thereby controlling blood glucose levels. It is indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.","Among 901 domestic clinical trial cases up to the time of approval, 103 cases ( 11.4%) showed clinical results that included abnormalities and side effects. These mainly included hypoglycemia, nasopharyngitis, and elevated lipase.Given the appearance of serious side effects such as hypoglycemia (0.1~5%) , administer medication in conjunction with close observation of patient status. Other DPP-4 inhibitors have been reported to present serious hypoglycemia in combination with Sulfonylurea medications as well as some cases of loss of consciousness. Moreover, decreased blood sugar from the use of this medication, once confirmed, can be remedied by giving sucrose. However, hypoglycemia resulting from a combination with glucosidase inhibitors should be treated with fructose."
Travoprost + Timolol Maleate,"Travoprost and Timolol reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by complementary mechanisms of action. Travoprost is a prostaglandin analogue which reduces IOP by increasing trabecular outflow & uveoscleral outflow. Timolol is a non-selective beta adrenergic receptor blocker that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane stabilizing) activity. It lowers IOP by decreasing the formation of aqueous humor in the ciliary epithelium.",No serious adverse reactions are reported. Most frequently reported side effects are ocular hyperemia.
Travoprost,"Travoprost, an isopropyl ester prodrug, is a synthetic prostaglandin F2 alpha analogue that is rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea to its biologically active free acid. The travoporst free acid is potent and highly selective for the FP prostanoid receptor.Travoprost free acid is a selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist and is believed to reduce intraocular pressure by increasing the drainage of aqueous humor, which is done primarily through increased uveoscleral outflow and to a lesser extent, trabecular outflow facility.",The most frequently reported treatment-related side-effect is ocular hyperaemia.
Vancomycin Hydrochloride,Vancomycin binds tightly to D-alanyl-D-alanine portion cell wall precursor causing blockage of glycopeptide polymerisation which produces immediate inhibition of cell wall synthesis and secondary damage to the cytoplasmic membrane.,"Vancomycin is well tolerated. However during or soon after rapid infusion of Vancomycin, patients may develop anaphylactic reactions including hypotension, wheezing, dyspnoea, urticaria or pruritus. Rapid infusion may also cause flushing of the upper body (""red neck"") or pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back. These reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes but may persist for several hours. Such events are infrequent if Vancomycin is given by a slow infusion over 60 minutes."
Valsartan + Hydrochlorothiazide,"Valsartan is an oral medication that belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It is orally active and specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin's attachment to the receptors cause the blood vessels to narrow (vasoconstrict) which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor. By blocking the action of angiotensin, Valsartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of anangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.","The combination of Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. The most common side effects include headache, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea and nausea. Patient may also experience hyperkalemia, impotency, reduced renal function, allergic reactions, dyspnea, constipation, back pain, muscle cramps, rash, anxiety, insomnia and vertigo. Hypotension may also occur."
Valsartan,"Valsartan is an oral medication that belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It is orally active and specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin's attachment to the receptors cause the blood vessels to narrow (vasoconstrict) which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor. By blocking the action of angiotensin, Valsartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.","Valsartan is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. The most common side effects include headache, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea and nausea. Patient may also experience hyperkalemia, impotency, reduced renal function, allergic reactions, dyspnea, constipation, back pain, muscle cramps, rash, anxiety, insomnia and vertigo. Hypotension may also occur if patient have been taking diuretics along with Valsartan."
Valganciclovir,"Valganciclovir is an L-valyl ester (prodrug) of ganciclovir, which after oral administration is rapidly converted to ganciclovir by intestinal and hepatic esterases. Ganciclovir is a synthetic analogue of 2’-deoxyguanosine, which inhibits replication of herpes viruses in vitro and in vivo. Sensitive human viruses include human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus-1 and -2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), human herpes virus 6, 7 and 8 (HHV-6, HHV-7, HHV-8), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and hepatitis B virus.In CMV-infected cells ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir mono-phosphate by the viral protein kinase, UL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. This has been shown to occur in HSV- and HCMV-infected cells with half-lives of 18 and between 6 and 24 hours respectively after removal of extracellular ganciclovir. As phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, the phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells.The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of viral DNA synthesis by: (a) competitive inhibition of incorporation of deoxyguanosine-triphosphate into DNA by viral DNA polymerase and (b) incorporation of ganciclovir triphosphate into viral DNA causing termination of, or very limited further viral DNA elongation. Typical antiviral IC 50 against CMV in vitro is in the range 0.08 μM (0.02 μg/ml) to 14 μM (3.5 μg/ml).The clinical antiviral effect of Valganciclovir has been demonstrated in the treatment of AIDS patients with newly diagnosed CMV retinitis (clinical trial WV15376). CMV shedding was decreased from 46% (32/69) of patients at study entry to 7% (4/55) of patients following 4 weeks of Valganciclovir treatment.","The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:

Valacyclovir,"Valacyclovir is the hydrochloride salt of L-valyl ester of the antiviral drug acyclovir. Valacyclovir is an antiviral drug. It slows the growth and spread of the herpes virus so that the body can fight off the infection. Valacyclovir lessens the symptoms of infections and shortens the length of time of sickness. Valacyclovir is used in the treatment and suppression of genital herpes, shingles and cold sores.","The most frequently reported adverse reactions were nausea (15%), headache (14%), vomiting (6%), dizziness (3%) and abdominal pain (3%)."
Ursodeoxycholic Acid,"Ursodeoxycholic Acid is a naturally occurring bile acid used to treat different hepatobilliary disorders. The activity of Ursodeoxycholic Acid is achieved through a decrease in secretion of cholesterol in bile. Ursodeoxycholic Acid achieves this through a few mechanisms: it reduces cholesterol absorption, suppresses liver cholesterol synthesis and it does not inhibit bile acid synthesis.Therefore, alters bile composition from supersaturated to unsaturated. Ursodeoxycholic Acid also promotes the formation of liquid cholesterol crystal complexes which enhance removal of the cholesterol from the gallbladder into the intestine to be expelled. Ursodeoxycholic Acid improves cholestatic liver diseases by-

Ursodeoxycholic Acid is completely absorbed in the upper intestine. Time to peak serum concentration varies from 30 to 150 minutes. The rate of absorption ranges from 60-80%. After absorption Ursodeoxycholic Acid enters the portal vein and undergoes extraction from portal blood by liver where it is conjugated with amino acid & that may be either glycine or taurine and then secreted into the hepatic bile ducts. Small quantities of Ursodeoxycholic Acid appear in the circulation and very small amounts are excreted into urine. The biologic half life of Ursodeoxycholic Acid ranges from 3.5-5.8 days.","Commonly reported side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gallstone opacilication, pruritus."
Urokinase,"Urokinase is used for the treatment of pulmonary embolisms. The low molecular weight form of human urokinase consists of an A chain of 2,000 daltons linked by a sulfhydryl bond to a B chain of 30,400 daltons. Urokinase is an enzyme (protein) produced by the kidney, and found in the urine. There are two forms of urokinase which differ in molecular weight but have similar clinical effects. Urokinase is the low molecular weight form. Urokinase acts on the endogenous fibrinolytic system. It converts plasminogen to the enzyme plasmin. Plasmin degrades fibrin clots as well as fibrinogen and some other plasma proteins.Urokinase acts on the endogenous fibrinolytic system. It cleaves the Arg-Val bond in plasminogen to produce active plasmin. Plasmin degrades fibrin clots as well as fibrinogen and other plasma proteins.","Overt bleeding, haemorrhagic complications, fever, haematuria, initial severe pain & dull ache in shunt limb."
Urea (25%),"Topical urea is bacteriostatic, bactericidal, fungistatic, proteolytic, hygroscopic and has mild local anesthetic properties. These actions are dose-dependent. Most of its therapeutic application depends on its hygroscopic properties. The hygroscopic property is due to its ability to cause a configurational change in proteins in the stratum corneum. Urea gently dissolves the intracellular matrix which results in loosening the horny layer of skin and shedding scaly skin at regular intervals, thereby softening hyperkeratotic areas. Therapeutic effects depend on local concentrations, not on systemic absorption of the drug. If absorbed, urea would be excreted unchanged in the urine.","No serious toxicity has been reported with topical urea. Historically it is considered a safe drug. But on some occasions, topical urea has been shown to cause burning and irritation, if applied to inflamed, broken or exudative skin eruptions."
Urea (10%),"Topical urea is bacteriostatic, bactericidal, fungistatic, proteolytic, hygroscopic and has mild local anesthetic properties. These actions are dose dependent. Most of its therapeutic applications depend on its hygroscopic properties. The hygroscopic property is due to its ability to cause configurational change in proteins in the stratum corneum. A 10% urea cream has been shown to increase the water holding capacity of ichthyotic scale by 100% after 3 weeks of treatment. There is no information available about percutaneous absorption of urea. Therapeutic effects depend on local concentrations, not on systemic absorption of the drug.

But on some occasions, topical urea has been shown to cause burning and irritation, if applied to inflamed, broken or exudative skin eruptions."
Upadacitinib,"Upadacitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence cellular processes of hematopoiesis and immune cell function. Within the signaling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Upadacitinib modulates the signaling pathway at the point of JAKs, preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs.","Adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 1%) are: upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, cough, and pyrexia."
Undenatured Type II Collagen + Glucosamine Sulfate + Chondroitin Sulfate,"Glucosamine is a naturally occurring amino sugar of cartilage that provides the basic raw material needed by the body to manufacture joint cartilage. Chondroitin is another naturally occurring mucopolysaccharide of cartilage that stimulates cartilage production, inhibits cartilage destroying enzymes, draws fluid to the cells and helps lubricate the joints. Glucosamine and Chondroitin work synergistically together to help stimulate the production and regeneration of connective tissues (e.g., cartilage, bone, tendon, skin, mucous membrane, blood vessels etc.). Undenatured Type II Collagen also known as Chicken Collagen Type II that works by oral tolerization. This Undenatured type II Collagen contains epitopes that interacts with the peyer’s patch in the intestine. It prevents the immune system from releasing destructive collagen specific T-cell. This T-cell is responsible for degradation of collagen in the joints. This causes halting the erosion of joint cartilage. As inflammation subsides the disequilibrium of cartilage turnover shifts in favor of rebuilding. It appears that once the destructive cycle is broken, the joint cartilage begins to repair itself through collagen building activities that are part of normal cartilage remodelling process.",Generally safe for most of the people but some may feel stomach problems.
Undenatured Type II Collagen + Glucosamine sulfate + Boswellia serrata + Boron,"Undenatured Type II collagen (UC-II): Undenatured Type II collagen (UC-II) is a nutritional supplement derived from chicken sternum cartilage using a patented, low-temperature, non-enzymatic manufacturing process that preserves the natural triple helix molecular configuration and its biological activity. UC-II has unique mechanism of action. UC-II molecules contain active binding sites called epitopes which trigger the process of oral tolerization. Through oral tolerization process, active epitopes of UC-II interact with Peyer’s patches (lymphoid tissue) of small intestine and it transforms T-cells into T- regulatory cells. T-regulatory cells then migrate to joint area and secrete anti-inflammatory mediators (cytokines), including the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). Thus it reduces joint inflammation and promotes cartilage repair. According to ORSI (osteoarthritis research society international), oral administration of UC-II diminished deterioration of articular cartilage of osteoarthritis (OA).Glucosamine sulfate: Glucosamine sulfate is a natural supplement. It is a sugar protein that helps build cartilage. Glucosamine, a normal constituent of glycosaminoglycans in cartilage matrix and synovial fluid, could have various pharmacological actions in articular cartilage and joint tissues. In randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, long-term administration of glucosamine sulfate can prevent joint structure changes in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee with a significant improvement in symptoms.Boswellia serrata: This plant extract promotes joint health by inhibiting inflammatory factors such as the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) enzyme and leukotriene B4, which affect aging joints. Extract of Boswellia serrata has been clinically studied for osteoarthritis, joint function & joint pain. Boswellia may also help reduce cartilage damage in arthritis. In a placebo-controlled clinical study, Boswellia extract improves signs of joint discomfort in just 8 weeks. Boswellia serrata as a promising alternative to NSAIDs.Boron (calcium fructoborate): It is a patented complex of calcium, fructose & boron found naturally in fresh and dried fruits, vegetables and herbs. Calcium fructoborate significantly reduces the C-reactive protein in humans. This unique plant-mineral complex is contribute to bone health by controlling the inflammation associated with loss of bone mineral density.","The combination of Undenatured Type II collagen, Glucosamine, Boswellia & Boron is generally well-tolerated in the recommended dose.

Undenatured collagen II has unique mechanism of action. Undenatured collagen II molecules contain active binding sites called epitopes which trigger the process of oral tolerization. Through oral tolerization process, active epitopes of undenatured collagen II interact with Peyer’s patches (lymphoid tissue) of small intestine to release collagen-specific regulatory T-cells. Collagen-specific regulatory T-cells then migrate to joint areas and prevent release of T-cells.Preventing the release of T-cells prevent the secretion of collagenase enzymes by macrophages responsible for breakdown of collagen in joint cartilage. It also slows the production of inflammatory cytokines resulting in reduction of inflammation, halting the erosion of joint cartilage and promote cartilage rebuilding. Undenatured Type II Collagen supports joint function, mobility and flexibilityand  also improves knee extension by up to 10% for better range of motion. It also relieves joint pain due to strenuous exercise.",Undenatured Type II Collagen is generally well tolerated in recommended dose. Over dose may cause constipation and headache.
Ulipristal Acetate [For uterine fibroids],"Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator. It acts by blocking the receptor of a hormone in the body called progesterone, which is involved in controlling the growth of the lining of the womb. In some women, progesterone may promote the growth of fibroids, which may cause symptoms such as heavy uterine bleeding, anaemia and abdominal pain. When progesterone activity is blocked, fibroid cells stop dividing and eventually die which reduces the size of the fibroids and reduces the symptoms caused by them.","Common side effects are Endometrial thickening, Hot flush, Headache, Uterine haemorrhage"
Ulipristal Acetate [For emergency contraception],"Ulipristal Acetate is an orally-active synthetic SPRM that acts via high-affinity binding to the human progesterone receptor. The primary mechanism of action is inhibition or delay of ovulation. Data shows that even when taken immediately before ovulation is scheduled to occur, Ulipristal Acetate is able to postpone follicular rupture in some women.","Most common side-effects are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, fatigue, dizziness, breast tenderness etc."
Tulobuterol Hydrochloride,"The primary pharmacological action of beta-adrenergic drugs is to stimulate adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the formation of cyclic-3',5' adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The cyclic AMP thus formed mediates the cellular response that results in bronchodilation. Tulobuterol, due to its highly selective action on beta-2 adrenoceptors, relaxes the bronchial smooth muscle and has been shown to be clinically successful in the symptomatic treatment of reversible obstructive airways disease (ROAD) such as bronchial asthma, and also in bronchitis and emphysema.Some bronchodilators stimulate beta-1 (cardiac) receptors in addition to beta-2 receptors and may cause tachycardia, angina, and possibly arrhythmias in susceptible patients. Animal studies and in vitro experiments indicate that tulobuterol is more selective in its beta-2 agonist activity than other agents in this class and, therefore, should produce fewer cardiac side effects.","The adverse reactions of tulobuterol are similar in nature to those of other sympathomimetic agents, however the incidence of certain cardiovascular effects is less with tulobuterol. Dose-related finger tremor is common with these agents, but the effects tend to lessen with continued administration of the drug. Oral formulations of tulobuterol, like other sympathomimetic agents, can also cause less frequent adverse reactions such as hypertension, palpitations, angina, tachycardia, vomiting, vertigo, central nervous system stimulation, insomnia and headache."
Trypan Blue,"Trypan Blue is a selective tissue staining agent (dye) which stains anterior lens capsule of the human crystalline lens. The dye does not penetrate the capsule, permitting visualization of the anterior capsule in contrast to the non-stained lens cortex and inner lens material.","Discoloration of high water content hydrogen intraocular lenses.

Mixed micelles is used as a solubilizing agent. It is presented as a lyophilized, orange-yellow, sterile powder that is to be reconstituted with 5ml of Water for injections or other parenteral fluids, (e.g. as 0.9% Sodium chloride or 5% Glucose solution), prior to administration by parenteral route.",Anaphylactic reactions have been reported following large intravenous doses of Thiamine. Urticaria and rash have also been associated with this preparation. There have been very rare reports of anaphylactic reactions following IV injection/infusion with this preparation over 1-4 minutes.
Vitamin A,"Beta-carotene, retinol, and retinal have effective and reliable vitamin A activity. Retinal and retinol are in chemical equilibrium in the body and have equivalent antixerophthalmic activity. Retinal combines with the rod pigment, opsin, in the retina to form rhodopsin, necessary for visual dark adaptation.Vitamin A prevents retardation of growth and preserves the epithe-lial cells' integrity. Normal adult liver storage is sufficient to satisfy two years'requirements of vitamin A. Vitamin A is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, where the biosynthesis of vitamin A from beta-carotene takes place. Vitamin A absorption requires bile salts, pancreatic lipase, and dietary fat. It is transported in the blood to the liver by the chy lomicron fraction of the lymph. Vitamin Ais stored in Kupffer cells of the liver mainly as the palmitate. Normal serum vitamin A is 80-300 Units per 100 mL (plasma range is 30-70 mcg per dl) and for carotenoids 270-753 Units per 100 mL.The normal adult liver contains approximately 100 to 300 micrograms per gram, mostly as retinol palmitate.","Vitamin A intoxication includes irritability, vomiting, loss of appetite, headache, dry and pruritic skin, skin desquamation, fatique, pain in ankles and feet, myalgia, loss of body hair, papilledema, nystagmus, liver sclerosis and cirrhosis."
Vinpocetine,"Vinpocetine increases cerebral metabolism; it increases glucose and O2 consumption; improves cerebral hypoxia tolerance; shifts glucose metabolism to the energetically more favourable aerobic pathway, but it increases the anaerobic pathway as well; it elevates the ATP concentration and the ATP/AMP ratio in the brain, and elevates the cerebral norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin levels.Vinpocetine considerably improves cerebral microcirculation by inhibiting platelet aggregation, reducing the pathologically increased blood viscosity, and increases erythrocyte deformability. It also promotes O2 transport into the tissues by reducing the O2 affinity of erythrocytes.It selectively and intensely increases cerebral blood flow and the share of the brain in cardiac output, it reduces cerebral vascular resistance without affecting systemic circulation (blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance). It does not elicit steal phenomenon; on the contrary, it primarily improves the blood supply of the injured and ischaemic area while it remains unchanged in the intact areas (inverse steal effect). It further increases blood flow which is already increased as a result of hypoxia.","Transient hypotension, tachycardia may occur."

Nausea, vomiting, GI bleed, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. Necrosis, cellulitis if extravasation occurs."
Vildagliptin + Metformin Hydrochloride,"Vildagliptin acts primarily by inhibiting DPP-4 (Dipeptidyl peptidase-4), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). The administration of Vildagliptin results in a rapid and complete inhibition of DPP-4 activity resulting in increased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP. By increasing the endogenous levels of these incretin hormones, Vildagliptin increases insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell and decreases glucagon secretion from alpha cell. The enhanced increase in the insulin/glucagon ratio during hyperglycaemia due to increased incretin hormone levels results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production, leading to reduced glycaemia.Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia. Glucomin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.","The most common side effects are headache, tremor, dizziness, nausea, hypoglycaemia etc."
Vildagliptin,"Vildagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Vildagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner.","The majority of adverse reactions were mild and transient, not requiring treatment discontinuations. A rare case of hepatic dysfunction is seen. Clinical trials of up to and more than 2 years duration did not show any additional safety signals or unforeseen risks when using this combination."
Vilazodone Hydrochloride,"The mechanism of action of vilazodone in the treatment of major depressive disorder is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to its enhancement of serotonergic activity in the CNS through selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake. Vilazodone is also a partial agonist at serotonergic 5-HT1A receptors; however, the net result of this action on serotonergic transmission and its role in vilazodone’s antidepressant effect are unknown.","Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults

Vilanterol Trifenatate + Fluticasone Furoate,"This preparation contains both futicasone furoate and vilanterol, the mechanisms of action described below for the individual components. These drugs represent 2 diferent classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a LABA) that have diferent efects on clinical and physiological aspects. The pharmacologic efects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including vilanterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3, 5-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. The precise mechanism through which futicasone furoate afects COPD and asthma symptoms is not known. Infammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of COPD and asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in infammation.","Common side efects in COPD: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥3%) are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, oral candidiasis, back pain, pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, arthralgia, hypertension, infuenza, pharyngitis, and pyrexia.Common side efects in Asthma: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥2%) are nasopharyngitis, oral candidiasis, headache, infuenza, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain, dysphonia, and cough."

Immediate-release verapamil has a relatively short duration of action, requiring dosing 3 to 4 times daily, but extended-release formulations are available that allow for once-daily dosing. As verapamil is a negative inotropic medication (i.e. it decreases the strength of myocardial contraction), it should not be used in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as the decrease in contractility caused by verapamil may increase the risk of exacerbating these pre-existing conditions.","Verapamil is generally well tolerated.

Varenicline Tartrate,"Varenicline binds with high affinity and selectivity at α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholinereceptors. The efficacy of Varenicline in smoking cessation is believed to be the result of varenicline's activity at α4β2 sub-type of the nicotinic receptor where its binding produces agonist activity, while simultaneously preventing nicotine binding to these receptors.Electrophysiology studies in vitro and neurochemical studies in vivo have shown that varenicline binds to α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and stimulates receptor-mediated activity, but at a significantly lower level than nicotine. Varenicline blocks the ability of nicotine to activate α4β2 receptors and thus to stimulate the central nervous mesolimbic dopamine system, believed to be the neuronal mechanism underlying reinforcement and reward experienced upon smoking. Varenicline is highly selective and binds more potently to α4β2 receptors than to other common nicotinic receptors ( >500-fold α3β4, >3,500fold α7, >20,000-fold α1βγδ), or to non-nicotinic receptors and transporters (> 2,000-fold). Varenicline also binds with moderate affinity (Ki = 350 nM) to the 5-HT3 receptor.","Nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, sinusitis, increased wt, decreased &/or increased appetite, abnormal dreams, insomnia, headache, somnolence, dizziness, dysgeusia, dyspnea, cough, nausea, GERD, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal distension & pain, toothache, dyspepsia, flatulence, dry mouth, rash, pruritus, arthralgia, myalgia, back pain, chest pain, fatigue, abnormal liver function test."
Vardenafil,"Vardenafil is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released in the corpus cavernosum & activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in an erection. Inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Because sexual stimulation is required to initiate the local release of nitric oxide, the inhibition of PDE5 has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.","The most common side effects with Vardenafil are headache, flushing, stuffy or runny nose, indigestion, upset stomach, dizziness or back pain."
Yellow Fever Vaccine,"Live, attenuated virus stimulates active immunity to Yellow fever; conveys active immunity via stimulation of production of endogenously produced antibodies. Yellow fever vaccine is used for active immunisation against yellow fever. Each dose (usually 0.5 ml) contains at least 1000 mouse LD50 units.","The following serious side effects have sometimes been reported: Allergic reactions:

Rash, itching or hives on the skin
Swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body
Difficulty swallowing or breathing
Loss of consciousness"
Xylometazoline Hydrochloride,"Nasal congestion is caused by various etiologies, such as rhinosinusitis and allergic or non-allergic rhinitis, leading to congestion of the venous sinusoids lining the nasal mucosa. Activation of α-adrenergic receptors leads to vasoconstriction of the blood vessels of the nasal mucosa and resumption of nasal airflow. As the most abundantly expressed in the human nasal mucosa, α1A- and α2B-adrenoceptors may play the most important role in vasoconstriction of the human nasal mucosa. Xylometazoline is a more selective agonist at α2B-adrenoceptors, with affinity at α1A-, α2A-, α2C-, α1B-, and α1D-adrenoceptors. Xylometazoline decreases nasal resistance during inspiration and expiration and increases the volume of nasal airflow. Compared to oxymetazoline, another imidazoline nasal decongestant, xylometazoline had a slightly faster onset of action although they had a similar duration of action. In one study, subjects with nasal congestion reported relief of earache and sore throat in addition to nasal decongestion: it is speculated that oxymetazoline mediates this effect by causing vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa that contains the venous sinuses and nasal decongestion allows breathing through the nose, providing relief from sore throat caused by mouth breathing that dries and irritates the throat.","The following side-effects have occasionally been encountered: 

A burning sensation in the nose and throat
Local irritation
Nausea and dryness of the nasal mucosa."
White soft paraffin + Liquid paraffin + Wool alcohol,"White soft paraffin, Liquid paraffin & Wool alcohol combination eye ointment produce a transparent, lubricating and moistening film on the surface of the eyeball. White soft paraffin, Liquid paraffin & Wool alcohol eye ointment provides soothing relief from the symptoms of dry eyes such as soreness, irritation or a gritty sensation. These may be caused by inadequate production of tears to keep the eye moist or by things such as certain medical conditions or treatment. The ointment also helps to protect the eyeball and can thus be useful for people who suffer from recurrent corneal epithelial erosion.","Stinging/redness in the eye, widened pupils or blurred vision may occur."
White Soft Paraffin + Liquid Paraffin,White Soft Paraffin and Liquid Paraffin are emollients with occlusive properties for topical application. There is no significant systemic absorption of the active ingredients but has substantial penetration into the stratum corneum.,"Prolong use may cause folliculitis, should this occur, use of the product should be discontinued."
Warfarin Sodium,"Warfarin is a [vitamin K] antagonist which acts to inhibit the production of vitamin K by vitamin K epoxide reductase. The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin KH2 is a cofactor used in the γ-carboxylation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin. Carboxylation induces a conformational change allowing the factors to bind Ca2+ and to phospholipid surfaces. Uncarboxylated factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin are biologically inactive and therefore serve to interrupt the coagulation cascade. The endogenous anticoagulation proteins C and S also require γ-carboxylation to function. This is particularly true in the case of thrombin which must be activated in order to form a thrombus. vitamin KH2 is converted to vitamin K epoxide as part of the γ-carboxylation reaction catalyzed by γ-glutamyl carboxylase. Vitamin K epoxide is then converted to vitamin K1 by vitamin K epoxide reductase then back to vitamin KH2 by vitamin K reductase. Warfarin binds to vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme thereby stopping the recycling of vitamin K by preventing the conversion of vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K1. This process creates a hypercoagulable state for a short time as proteins C and S degrade first with half lives of 8 and 24 hours, with the exception of factor VII which has a half life of 6 hours. Factors IX, X, and finally thrombin degrade later with half lives of 24, 36, and 50 hours resulting in a dominant anticoagulation effect. In order to reverse this anticoagulation vitamin K must be supplied, either exogenously or by removal of the vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibition, and time allowed for new coagulation factors to be synthesized. It takes approximately 2 days for new coagulation factors to be synthesized in the liver. Vitamin K2, functionally identical to vitamin K1, is synthesized by gut bacteria leading to interactions with antibiotics as elimination of these bacteria can reduce vitamin K2","Hemorrhage is the principal adverse effect of oral anticoagulants. Other adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersensitivity, rash, alopecia, and unexplained drop in haematocrit, ""purple toes"", skin necrosis, jaundice, and hepatic dysfunction."
Voriconazole,Voriconazole is a triazole antifungal medication used to treat serious fungal infections. Voriconazole binds and inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting CYP450-dependent 14-alpha sterol demethylase. The inhibition of 14-alpha sterol demethylase results in a depletion of ergosterol in fungal cell membrane.,"The most common side effects are abdominal pain, anemia, blurred vision, headache, chest pain, nausea and diarrhea."
Voglibose,"Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are saccharides that act as competitive inhibitors of enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates: specifically alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines. The membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Acarbose also blocks pancreatic alpha-amylase in addition to inhibiting membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drugs therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels: the long term effect is a small reduction in hemoglobin-A1c level.","Diarrhoea, loose stools, abdominal pain, constipation, loss of appetite, urge to vomit (nausea), vomiting, heartburn, increased gas, and intestinal obstruction like symptoms due to increased intestinal gas. OHAs plus voglibose may cause hypoglycaemia (0.1% to <5%), delay in digestion and absorption of disaccharides, fulminant hepatitis, serious liver dysfunction with increased liver enzymes, jaundice, anaemia, numbness, edema, blurred vision, hot flushes, malaise, weakness, hyperkalemia, increased pancreatic enzyme (serum amylase)."
"Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Lutein, Copper & Zinc","Vitamin C is highly concentrated in the lens compared to blood. A long term Vitamin C supplement use (10+ years) has been associated with reduced risk of cataract. Vitamin C has an important role in harmful free radicals scavenging activity.In study, it is found that high serum Vitamin E concentrations have been associated with reduced risk of cataract (exact mechanism of action is not still established). As an antioxidant vitamin, it also plays an important role in harmful free radicals scavenging activity.Lutein is a carotenoid, specially concentrated in the macula. Clinical and animaldata indicates that this caretenoid could protect the macula from oxidative or light damage. Although exact mechanism of action is not clear but onelarge study has found that high levels of dietary Lutein is associated with relatively lower risk of AMD (Age-Related Macular Degeneration). Zinc is an essential trace element involved in many enzymes system.Symptoms of less severe deficiency include distorted or absent perception of taste, smell and poor wound healing. Severe deficiency causes skin lesion, alopecia, diarrhea, increased susceptibility to infection and failure to thrive in children.Copper plays important role in growth, skeletal integrity, and development of nervous system. As a part of various enzymes, it takes part in numerous metabolic conversions.","Large doses of Vitamin C are reported to cause diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disturbances. Large doses of Vitamin E may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and other gastrointestinal disturbances; fatigue and weakness have also been reported. Side effects of Zinc salt are abdominal pain and dyspepsia."
Vitamin C + Vitamin E,"Vitamin C: Necessary for collagen formation and tissue repair; plays a role in oxidation/reduction reactions as well as other metabolic pathways including synthesis of catecholamines, carnitine, and steroids; also plays a role in conversion of folic acid to folinic acid.Vitamin E plays a role in protecting red blood cells against hemolysis; has protective effects against free radicals on polyunsaturated fatty acids found in cell membranes; plays a role in preventing oxidation of vitamin A and C.","Generally, this preparation is well-tolerated. Diarrhea may occasionally occur during treatment with beta carotene and the skin may assume a slightly yellow discoloration. The side-effects of vitamin A are reversible. Vitamin C and vitamin E may cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disturbances."
Vitamin C + Vitamin D3 + Folic acid,"Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) & Folic acid (also known as Vitamin B9) are water-soluble vitamins. Vitamin D is fat-soluble. Ascorbic acid helps integration & cohesiveness of cells by synthesizing collagen which is also known as biological glue. It is also a powerful antioxidant in the aqueous media. Vitamin D is also known as antirachitic and sun-shine vitamin which displays its roles like a hormone (pro-hormone). Vitamin D spares calcium in the body by reducing excretion and enhancing calcium absorption. Folic acid is crucial for proper brain function and plays an important role in mental and emotional health. It aids in the production of DNA and RNA, the body's genetic material, and is especially important during periods of high growth, such as infancy, adolescence and pregnancy. It controls blood levels of the amino acid Homocysteine. Elevated levels of this substance appear to be linked to certain chronic conditions such as heart disease. Indications: Deficiency states of Vitamin C, Vitamin D and Folic acid associated with cardiovascular diseases, Deficiency states of Vitamin-C (Scurvy, generalized weakness, gum bleeding, after acute infections, alcoholism and postoperatively), Wound healing, Prevention of cold, flue and influenza, Megaloblastic anemia and anemia of nutritional origin, Deficiency states of Vitamin-D (Intestinal malabsorption, chronic liver disease, osteomalacia, osteopenia, rickets, hypocalcemia, institutionalized patients, persons who use sunscreen, black people, person who covers most of the body surface due to cultural and religious purpose). Familial hypophosphatemia, Hypoparathyroidism, As adjuvant with calcium supplement, Prevention of osteoporosis and fracture alone or in combination with calcium supplement, Conditions where demand for Vitamin-C, Vitamin-D and Folic acid increases (pregnancy, lactation, smoking and old age, person living in polluted environment).","Vitamin C, Vitamin D3 & Folic acid combination is well tolerated. Mild gastrointestinal disturbances may occur."
Vitamin C [Ascorbic acid],"vitamin C, the water-soluble vitamin, is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is widely distributed in the body tissues. It is believed to be involved in biological oxidations and reductions used in cellular respiration. It is essential for the synthesis of collagen and intracellular material. Vitamin C deficiency develops when the dietary intake is inadequate and when increased demand is not fulfilled. Deficiency leads to the development of well defined syndrome known as scurvy, which is characterized by capillary fragility, bleeding (especially from small blood vessels and the gums), anaemia, cartilage and bone lesions and slow healing of wounds.","Vitamin C has little toxicity and only mega-doses of vitamin C may cause diarrhoea, abdominal bloating, iron over-absorption that is harmful in patients with thalassaemia, sideroblastic anemia, and haemochromatosis; hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, and hemolysis in patients with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. A pregnant woman taking more than 5 gm/day may suffer fetal abortion."
"Vitamin B6, B9 & B12","Pyrodoxine (Vitamin B6) is a water-soluble vitamin which functions in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. It is essential in Hb formation and GABA synthesis within the CNS. It also aids in the release of glycogen stored in the liver and muscles.Folic acid (Vitamin B9) is essential for the production of certain coenzymes in many metabolic systems such as purine and pyrimidine synthesis. It is also essential in the synthesis and maintenance of nucleoprotein in erythropoesis. It also promotes WBC and platelet production in folate-deficiency anaemia.Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) is vital to growth, hematopoiesis and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. As a hematopoietic agent, it is converted to coenzyme B12 needed in the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate and production of methionine from homocysteine, a reaction requiring folate. In the absence of folate, such metabolites cannot be formed and folate deficiency occurs. It is also involved in the maintenance of reduced sulfhydryl (SH) groups which are required by various SH-activated enzyme systems. Through such processes, cyanocobalamin participates in fat and carbohydrate metabolism as well as protein synthesis.","Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Paresthesia, somnolence, nausea and headache have been reported with pyridoxine hydrochlloride. Mild transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, itching, transitory exanthema, and the feeling of swelling of the entire body has been associated with cyanocobalamin.Elevate your arsenal by taking things to the next level with louboutin herrenschuhe, two new additions to the collection that mirror Streetwall's attention to detail with matching perforated ecussons. Men just like herrenschuhe very much."
Vitamin B12 + Elemental Iron + Folic Acid,"Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin): Required for the maintenance of normal erthropoiesis, nucleprotein and myelin synthesis, cell reproduction and normal growth; Coenzyme; metabolic functions include protein synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. Plays role in cell replication and hematopoiesis.Iron: Essential component in the formation of hemoglobin; adequate amounts of iron are necessary for effective erythropoiesis; also serves as a cofactor of several essential enzymes, including cytochromes that are involved in electron transport. Replacement of iron stores found in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and enzymes; works to transport oxygen via hemoglobin.Folic acid: Required for nucleoprotein synthesis and the maintenance of normal erythropoiesis; folic acid is converted in the liver and plasma to its metabolically active form, tetrahydrofolic acid, by dihydrofolate reductase; prevents neural tube defects in women of childbearing potential and higher doses required during pregnancy.","Generally well tolerated. In individual cases, a few side-effects occur to oral Iron preparation, such as nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhoea."
"Vitamin B1, B2 & B6","Thiamine (Vitamin B1) forms thiamine pyrophosphate by combining with adenosine triphosphate; essential coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism.Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is required for energy utilisation from food. It is essential for normal tissue respiration. It is also necessary for the activation of pyridoxine and conversion of tryptophan to nicotinic acid.Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is a water-soluble vitamin which functions in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. It is essential in Hb formation and GABA synthesis within the CNS. It also aids in the release of glycogen stored in the liver and muscles.","Adverse reactions have been reported with specific vitamins, and generally at levels substantially higher than those in Vitamin B1, B2 & B6. However, allergic and idiosyncratic reactions are possible at lower levels."
"Vitamin B1, B6 & B12","Vitamin B1 converts carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids into energy, promotes healthy nerves, improves mood, strengthens the heart. Vitamin B6 forms RBCs, helps cells to make proteins, manufactures neurotransmitters e.g. serotonin and releases stored forms of energy, helps to prevent CVS diseases and stroke, helps to lift depression and eases insomnia. Vitamin B12 is essential for cell replication and important for RBC production, prevents anemia, helps to prevent depression, reduces nerve pain, numbness, tingling and lowers the risk of heart diseases.The vitamin ingredients are absorbed well in per oral reception. It is widely distributed to most tissues and appears in breast milk. Within the cell, thiamine is mostly present as diphosphate. Thiamine is not stored to any appreciable extent in the body and amounts in excess of the body’s requirements are excreted in the urine as unchanged thiamine or as metabolites. Pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine are readily absorbed from the GIT following oral administration and are converted to the active forms of pyridoxal phosphate an pyridoxamine phosphate. They are stored mainly in liver where there is oxidation to 4-pyridoxic acid and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted in urine. As the dose increases, proportionally greater amounts are excreted unchanged in the urine.",Generally well tolerated but allergic reactions may be observed in few cases.
Vitamin B Complex + Zinc,"Zinc is vital for many biological functions such as immunity enhancement, wound healing, digestion, reproduction, physical growth and mental development. Zinc supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. Zinc also has some antioxidant properties. Zinc is used to treat ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyper-activity Disorder) in children. In adult, due to zinc deficiency loss of appetite, poor sense of taste and smell, tendency towards depression, white marks on fingernails, frequent infections, low fertility, prostate problems, mental problems, poor wound healing, a poor immune system, diarrhoea, mental lethargy, rough skin and weight loss may occur.B-Vitamins are needed to release energy from food. They play an important role in ensuring healthy brain and nerve function, healthy red blood cells formation in children & adults. They are specially needed for healthy growth and development of children. B-Vitamin deficiencies in adult cause profound fatigue and various types of neurologic manifestations, which may include weakness, poor balance, confusion, irritability, memory loss, nervousness, tingling of the limbs and loss of coordination. Additional symptoms of vitamin B deficiency are sleep disturbances, nausea, poor appetite, frequent infections, and skin lesions.","This is generally well tolerated. However, a few side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea & stomach upset may occur. Side effects have been reported with specific vitamins but generally at levels substantially higher than recommended doses."
Vitamin B complex + Vitamin C,"Vitamin B-Complex and Vitamin C function as cofactors of various enzymes which regulate carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism. Thiamine (B.,) acts as a cofactor in the decarboxylation of keto acids such as pyruvic acid.Riboflavin (B2) plays a vital role in cellular respiratory reactions in conjunction with nicotinamide.Pyridoxine (B6) takes part in decarboxylation and interconversion of amino acids. It is also required for normal antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immune responses.Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) is required for synthesis of DNA (deoxyribo-nucleic acid) and maturation of RBCs (red blood cells). Nicotinamide (niacinamide) plays a vital role in cellular respiration in conjunction with riboflavin.Calcium Pantothenate functions as a cofactor for enzymes involved in transfer of acetyl groups. It is also required for normal antibody response in conjunction with pyridoxine.Folic acid, after conversion in the body to folinic acid, takes part in reactions involved in the synthesis of nucleotides and maturation of RBCs in conjunction with vitamin B12. It also plays an important role in lymphocyte-mediated immune response.Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) takes part in biochemical reactions involving oxidation, as in collagen synthesis, and in conversion of folic acid to folinic acid. It is also necessary for normal phagocytic function ofWBCs (white blood cells).Thus an adequate supply of these water-soluble vitamins is required for the optimum function of various cells and tissues.Except for Vitamin B12, these water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body to any significant extent, the excess quantities being excreted in the urine. Therefore, a regular and adequate intake of them is necessary to meet the metabolic requirements. Deficiencies of water-soluble vitamins often co-exist because of their overlapping dietary sources and metabolic interdependence. Initially the deficiency of these vitamins may be subclinical and demonstrable only by means of biochemical tests. If not corrected at this stage, it may become manifest as various symptoms, including impaired wound healing and increased susceptibility to infection. Classical deficiency diseases such as beri beri, pellagra and scurvy are rare, whereas mild and subclinical deficiencies are probably more common, even among apparently healthy individuals.","Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with thiamine and folic acid, although these are rare."
Vitamin B complex,"Vitamin-B complex contains the most important members of the vitamin B group in pure form and in therapeutically balanced proportions. The members of the vitamin B group contained in Vitamin-B complex are components of enzyme systems that regulate various stages of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism, each of the components playing a specific biological role. Deficiency of B vitamin causes glossitis, stomatitis, cheilosis, polyneuritis, beriberi, pellagra and vascularisation of cornea.","Adverse reactions have been reported with specific vitamins and minerals, but generally at levels substantially higher than those in Vitamin-B complex. However, allergic and idiosyncratic reactions are possible at lower levels. Iron, even at the usual recommended level has been associated with gastrointestinal intolerance in some patients."
Zuclopenthixol,"Zuclopenthixol, a thioxanthene derivative, has high affinity for both dopamine D1 receptors and dopamine D2 receptors. Zuclopenthixol also has high affinity for α1 -adrenergic and 5 HT2 receptors. It has weaker histamine H1 receptor blocking activity, and even lower affinity for muscarinic cholinergic and α2 -adrenergic receptors.","Common side effects are Racing heart (tachycardia), a sensation of a rapid, forceful, or irregular beating of the heart (palpitations) Tremor, twisting or repetitive movements or abnormal postures due to sustained muscle contractions (dystonia), increased muscle stiffness (hypertonia)."
Zopiclone,"Zopiclone, a cyclopyrrolone derivative, is a short-acting hypnotic agent. This is structurally unrelated to existing hypnotics. However, the pharmacological profile of Zopiclone is similar to that of the benzodiazepines. Zopiclone pharmacological properties are: hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, anti-convulsant, muscle-relaxant. These effects are related to a specific agonist action at central receptors belonging to the GABAA macromolecular complex, modulating the opening of the chloride ion channel.","Common side effects are somnolence, dizziness, confusion, anterograde amnesia or memory impairment, feeling of drunkenness, euphoria, nightmares, agitation, anxiety or nervousness, hostility, depression, decreased libido, libido disorder, coordination abnormality, headache, hypotonia, tremor, muscle spasms, paresthesia, and speech disorder, palpitations, dysgeusia (bitter taste), dry mouth, coated tongue, bad breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia or increased appetite."
Zonisamide,"The precise mechanism(s) by which zonisamide exerts its antiseizure effect is unknown. Zonisamide demonstrated anticonvulsant activity in several experimental models. In animals, zonisamide was effective against tonic extension seizures induced by maximal electroshock but ineffective against clonic seizures induced by subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol. Zonisamide raised the threshold for generalized seizures in the kindled rat model and reduced the duration of cortical focal seizures induced by electrical stimulation of the visual cortex in cats. Furthermore, zonisamide suppressed both interictal spikes and the secondarily generalized seizures produced by cortical application of tungstic acid gel in rats or by cortical freezing in cats. The relevance of these models to human epilepsy is unknown.Zonisamide may produce these effects through action at sodium and calcium channels. In vitro pharmacological studies suggest that zonisamide blocks sodium channels and reduces voltagedependent, transient inward currents (T-type Ca2+ currents), consequently stabilizing neuronal membranes and suppressing neuronal hypersynchronization. In vitro binding studies have demonstrated that zonisamide binds to the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor ionophore complex in an allosteric fashion which does not produce changes in chloride flux. Other in vitro studies have demonstrated that zonisamide (10–30 μg/mL) suppresses synaptically-driven electrical activity without affecting postsynaptic GABA or glutamate responses (cultured mouse spinal cord neurons) or neuronal or glial uptake of [3H]-GABA (rat hippocampal slices). Thus, zonisamide does not appear to potentiate the synaptic activity of GABA. In vivo microdialysis studies demonstrated that zonisamide facilitates both dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission.Zonisamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. The contribution of this pharmacological action to the therapeutic effects of zonisamide is unknown. However, as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, zonisamide may cause metabolic acidosis","The most common adverse reactions with Zonisamide (an incidence at least 4% greater than placebo) in controlled clinical trials and shown in descending order of frequency were somnolence, anorexia, dizziness, ataxia, agitation/irritability, and difficulty with memory and/or concentration.In controlled clinical trials, 12% of patients receiving Zonisamide as adjunctive therapy discontinued due to an adverse reaction compared to 6% receiving placebo. Approximately 21% of the 1,336 patients with epilepsy who received Zonisamide in clinical studies discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were somnolence, fatigue and/or ataxia (6%), anorexia (3%), difficulty concentrating (2%), difficulty with memory, mental slowing, nausea/vomiting (2%), and weight loss (1%). Many of these adverse reactions were doserelated"
Zolpidem Tartrate,"Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine derivative that acts by binding to the benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors of the GABA receptor complex resulting in neuronal hyperpolarisation, action potential inhibition, increased in chloride conductance and decreased in neuronal excitability. It has strong sedative action but only minimal anxiolytic, myorelaxant and anticonvulsant properties due to its selectivity for the BZ1-receptor over the BZ2-receptor. Zolpidem has a rapid onset but short duration of hypnotic action.","Atypical thinking and behaviour, hallucination, nightmare, somnolence, somnambulism, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, vertigo, drowsiness, asthenia, ataxia, rebound insomnia, amnesia, GI disturbances, upper and lower respiratory tract infection, fatigue, visual disturbances, increased ALT serum concentrations, abnormal LFT."
Zolmitriptan,Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of Zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which results in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.,"Most common adverse reactions were neck/throat/jaw pain or pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth."
Zoledronic Acid [For osteoporosis],"Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously administered Zoledronic acid is rapidly distributed to bone. The main molecular target of Zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, but this does not exclude other mechanisms. There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged via the kidney.","The post-dose side-effects are fever, myalgia, flu-like symptoms, arthralgia and headache, the majority of which occur within the first 3 days following Zoledronic Acid administration. The majority of these symptoms were mild to moderate in nature and resolved within 3 days of the event onset. The incidence of these symptoms occurring within the first 3 days after administration of Zoledronic Acid, can be reduced with the administration of Paracetamol or Ibuprofen shortly following Zoledronic Acid administration. Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking Zoledronic Acid."
Zoledronic Acid [For hypercalcemia],"Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously administered Zoledronic acid is rapidly distributed to bone. The main molecular target of Zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, but this does not exclude other mechanisms. Clinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcemia demonstrated that the effect of Zoledronic acid is characterized by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In addition to its inhibitory activity against bone resorption, Zoledronic acid also possesses anti-tumour activity, anti-angiogenic activity, anti-pain activity, cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on tumour cells and synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer drugs. There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged via the kidney.","The post-dose side-effects are headache, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, osteonecrosis of jaw, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, flu-like syndrome, hypocalcemia, myalgia, arthralgia and hypophosphataemia."
Ziprasidone,"The mechanism of action of ziprasidone in the treatment of the listed indications could be mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Ziprasidone binds with relatively high affinity to the dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT1A, 5HT1D, and α1-adrenergic receptors (Ki s of 4.8, 7.2, 0.4, 1.3, 3.4, 2, and 10 nM, respectively), and with moderate affinity to the histamine H1 receptor (Ki=47 nM). Ziprasidone is an antagonist at the D2, 5HT2A, and 5HT1D receptors, and an agonist at the 5HT1A receptor. Ziprasidone inhibited synaptic reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. No appreciable affinity was exhibited for other receptor/binding sites tested, including the cholinergic muscarinic receptor (IC50 >1 µM).","Commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and at least twice the incidence for placebo) were:

Schizophrenia: Somnolence, respiratory tract infection.

Intramuscular administration (≥5% and at least twice the lowest intramuscular ziprasidone group): Headache, nausea, somnolence."
Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate,"Zinc sulphate monohydrate is an essential trace element and is involved in a number of body enzyme systems. The body needs zinc for normal growth and health. Zinc is also vital for sexual maturation and reproduction, dark vision adaptation, olfactory and gustatory activity, insulin storage & release and for a variety of host immune defenses. Zinc deficiency may lead to impaired immune function, delayed wound healing, a decrease in sense of taste and smell, a reduced ability to fight infections, poor night vision, increased risk of abortion, alopecia, mental lethargy, skin changes and poor development of reproductive organs.","Zinc may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach upset, heartburn and gastritis."
"Zinc oxide, Octinoxate, Enzacamene and Avobenzone","This cream is a combination of 4 ingredients which provide a highly protective sunscreen action.Thus, it protects against the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays of sun which can cause skin cancer, wrinkle, premature aging and darkening of skin. Its Sun Protection Factor (SPF) is 60 & Protection Grade of UVA (PA) is +++, making it perfect for both UVA & UVB protection. Zinc Oxide acts as screen and reflects & scatters UV radiation in order to protect the skin.Avobenzone,Octinoxate and Enzacamene absorb UV radiation and convert it to heat, which is then released from the skin. Strong stay-on properties making it long lasting sunscreen.","Signs of irritations (erythema, burning or rash) may appear when applied to sensitive or broken skin."
Zinc oxide + Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate + 4-Methylbenzylidene Camphor + Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane,"Zinc oxide has astringent, soothing and protective properties and is used in topical preparations for eczema, slight excoriations, wounds and haemorrhoids. It also reflects ultraviolet radiation and can be used as a physical sunscreen.","Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue)."
Zinc oxide + Benzyl alcohol + Benzyl benzoate + Benzyl cinnamate + Lanolin,"Zinc oxide: A dermatological agent with astringent, soothing and protective properties.
Benzyl alcohol: A local anaesthetic with disinfectant properties.
Benzyl benzoate: An acaricide and has been used as a pediculicide, insect repellent and pharmaceutical solubilising agent. It is a constituent of many natural balsams and is one of the principal esters of Peru Balsam.
Benzyl cinnamate: This is the other principal ester of Peru Balsal BPC 1973. It is synthetised from benzyl alcohol and cinnamic acid which has antibacterial and antifungal properties. Peru Balsam is categorised as having a mild antiseptic action because of cinnamic acid and its derivatives present.
Lanolin: Resembles the sebaceous secretions of human skin. The grade (hypoallergenic) used is manufactured so as to exclude many sensitising substances present in the lanolin.",Side effects include local hypersensitivity occasionally.
Zinc Oxide [Microfine],"Zinc oxide has astringent, soothing and protective properties and is used in topical preparations for eczema, slight excoriations, wounds and haemorrhoids. It also reflects ultraviolet radiation and can be used as a physical sunscreen.","Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue)."
Zinc Oxide,"Zinc oxide is used to treat or prevent minor skin irritations such as burns, cuts, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and diaper rash. It is also used as sunscreen.",Usually well tolerated. Extremely low frequency of hypersensitivity reaction.
Zinc Orotate,"Zinc, a major mineral, plays a part in almost all the body's cellular and enzymatic processes. Its bioavailability and digestive assimilation increases significantly when bound to orotic acid. An essential component of over 80 enzymes, it plays a role in all metabolism and has a specific antioxidant, anti-free radical action.","Zinc might cause nausea, vomiting, metallic taste and stomach upset etc."
Zidovudine,"Zidovudine is converted intracellularly to zidovudine triphosphate, which inhibits replication of retroviruses, including HIV, by interfering with viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase).","Dizziness, headache, malaise, myalgia, GI symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting), anorexia, immune reconstitution syndrome, lipodystrophy, metabolic abnormalities, mitochondrial dysfunction, osteonecrosis; raised liver enzymes, creatine phosphokinase; hyperbilirubinaemia, myalgia, myositis. Rarely, aplastic anaemia, pure red cell aplasia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy, convulsions, pancreatitis."
Zaleplon,"Zaleplon is a newer non-benzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class. So, its chemical structure is unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties. It interacts with the gamma aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABA-BZ) receptor complex.","Side effects of Zaleplon appear to be dose related. So, it is important to use the lowest possible effective dose, specially in the elderly. The side effects are usually mild and transient, the most common are diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, headache, asthenia, nightmare etc."
Zafirlukast,"Zafirlukast is a selective and competitive leukotriene-receptor antagonist (LTRA) of leukotriene D4 and E4 (LTD4 and LTE4), components of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRSA). Cysteinyl leukotriene production and receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma, including airway oedema, smooth muscle constriction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.","Effect on ability to drive or operate machinery: There is no evidence that Zafirlukast affects the ability to drive and use machinery. Administration of Zafirlukast in clinical trials against placebo has been associated with headache (9.9% vs. 9.0%) or gastrointestinal disturbance (nausea 2.6% vs. 2.2%, vomiting 1.2% vs. 1.0%, diarrhoea 2.3% vs. 1.8%, abdominal pain 1.6% vs. 1.2%). These symptoms are usually mild and do not necessitate withdrawal from therapy. During post-marketing experience, bruising, bleeding disorders, including menorrhagia (rare), thrombocytopaenia and agranulocytosis (very rare) have also been reported.Hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria and angio-oedema have been reported. Rashes, including blistering, have also been reported. The above events have usually resolved during continued treatment or following cessation of therapy. Infrequently, elevated serum transaminase levels have been observed in clinical trials against placebo with Zafirlukast (increased AST 1.0% vs. 0.9%, increased AST 0.6% vs. 0.6%); at recommended doses the incidence was equivalent to placebo. Rarely the transaminase profile has been consistent with drug-induced hepatitis, which resolved following cessation of Zafirlukast therapy. During post-marketing experience there have been rare reports of hepatitis, with or without elevated bilirubin levels. These cases were usually reversible.In placebo controlled clinical trials, an increased incidence of infection has been observed in elderly patients given Zafirlukast (7.8% vs. 1.4%). Infections were usually mild, predominantly affecting the respiratory tract."
